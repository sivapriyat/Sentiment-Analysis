NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region’s third-largest lender. The entity’s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets.\""

Finding workers to drive trucks has increasingly been an issue in the industry, according to Seidl. “Clearly, we've had some problems hiring truckers lately,” he said in a segment with Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. “I've been around the trucking industry almost 30 years, and I've never quite seen it this bad.” A labor shortage beginning early 2021 has stretched across multiple industries across the nation, but the trucking industry in particular has sustained some nasty blows to its labor force. According to the American Truckers Association, the US currently faces an all-time high shortage of 80,000 truckers. An infrastructure bill signed into law by President Biden attempts to alleviate some of these concerns for the trucking industry and transportation services in general. The $1.2 trillion law includes provisions for roads and bridges amounting to $110 billion as well as $17 billion for ports. “Our baseline view right now is things get a little bit better in December, then we get tight again in January,” Seidl said. “We start probably clearing up around 2Q and into the back half of the year. Look, we have an infrastructure bill that is signed into law … That's going to help. But that's not going to really get us any near-term help.” Disruption issues are embedded deeply within the supply chain, Seidl added. “It goes beyond just a handful of large retailers, right?” he said. “So it goes to the port truckers, it goes to the warehousing operations, it goes to the railroads. This is an entire supply chain. And so, these are all links of the chain.” Seasonal variances may help right the metaphorical ship for ports-based infrastructure, Seidl said, as reduced traffic in the winter months may ease supply-demand imbalances. “If you look at right now, yeah, things are bad now, but the calendar is going to be our friend with seasonality,” he noted. “Typically, post-Thanksgiving the ports get a lot slower.

It becomes more thrilling as the gamers have to race against the AI's. On being successful, they earn rewards. According to Fred Bruno, the CEO and Founder of Outrace, the company now has emerged as a very prominent name in-car gaming. Different cars have been made available with varying stats and abilities for the racers that suit their racing style and desire to become a champion. The new racing games have been developed by the same team as BCPAY FINTECH $BCPAY (formerly Bitcashpay $BCP), both $BCPAY and $ORE tokens can be used in the game, Fred Bruno said $BCPAY can be used to buy car accessories and $ORE can be used in expanding the gamer's garage. The winning races are entitled to get a reward on the racer's $ORE token. A player can begin the Outrace play by first deciding to be a Crew Leader or a Crew Racer. To be a Crew Leader, however, the gamer must have a garage as, without it, the gamer cannot buy a car. Subsequently, the player cannot start a race. For the Crew Racers, owning a garage is not necessary as they make a Contract with a Crew Leader to enter into his or her team to participate in the race. This is the reason why owning a garage is so important for the Crew Leader. Another practical reason is that if the Crew Leader has more slots in the garage, a greater number of the more Racers can participate in the racing contract. Outrace players can participate in 3 different game modes which are: 1. Conqueror Mode: Player has the option to race against AI on Pearl Island.\",\n",

The report, The Canadian Video Game Industry: 2021, found that during a year whose first half was defined by an economic downturn, the video game industry grew significantly, as consumers worldwide turned to video games to stay entertained and connected while maintaining social distance. \"Canadian video games are an innovative and critical export sector – we bring Canadian talent and Canadian stories to the world stage,\" says Jayson Hilchie, Chief Executive Officer at the Entertainment Software Association of Canada. \"And with 84% of our sales to foreign markets, driving billions of dollars of revenue and supporting tens of thousands of good jobs, it\\'s safe to say our industry is making a global impact.\" Canada\\'s business environment combines competitive labour costs with a highly skilled workforce. Together, this is the secret sauce that has allowed Canada\\'s video game industry to punch above its national weight throughout the pandemic, creating jobs, generating economic activity, and now – as lockdowns end and as vaccination increases – helping drive the much-needed economic recovery.

In addition, the industry supports a further 23,000 indirect jobs across the Canadian economy. In total, the industry supports 55,300 Canadian jobs from coast to coast. \"Canada has an excellent business environment and a diverse talent pool,\" says Marija Nastic-Radulovic, EA\\'s SVP of Development Technology & Solutions. \"This landscape allows EA to have studios in multiple Canadian cities including',\n",

       "  ' By Cynthia Kim SEOUL (Reuters) - Many small business owners in South Korea recognise themselves in the cash-strapped characters of the wildly popular Netflix drama \\'Squid Game\\', who vie desperately for a chance to win $38 million, exposing a debt trap that is all too familiar. Nearing retirement at 58, Yu Hee-sook paid off her debts long ago, but still gets calls from collection agencies threatening to seize her bank accounts, as the loans got securitised and sold to investors without her knowledge. \"In Korea, it\\'s like the end of the world once you become a credit delinquent,\" said Yu, who got by on small jobs, such as writing for movie magazines, during the 13 years it took to pay off the debts she incurred over a movie that flopped in 2002. \"All I wanted was chances to repay debt, but banks don\\'t let you make money,\" added Yu, who feels trapped in an unforgiving life-long ordeal, just like the 456 game show contestants of the \\'Squid Game\\'. While foreigners may associate South Korea with the boyband BTS and sleek Samsung smartphones, the drama points to a dark flipside of rising personal borrowing, the highest suicide rate among advanced nations, and the rarity of getting free of debt. Record household borrowing is fuelling private investment and housing growth, but unforgiving social mores about debt often blur the line between personal and business loans, burdening those who run small businesses. Personal bankruptcies soared to a five-year high of 50,379 last year, court filings show. The proportion of those falling behind on more than one type of personal debt payment has risen steadily to reach 55.47% by June from 48% in 2017, figures from the Korea Credit Information Services show. \"If Donald Trump was a Korean, he probably couldn\\'t have become the president, having been bankrupted many times,\" said a lawyer in Seoul, who specialises in personal bankruptcy. \"In the United States, corporate debt is more separated from personal debt.\" An inadequate social safety net for small entrepreneurs and the lack of a rehabilitation programme for failures spell risks that could',\n",

It's still ridiculous how long it took to add a search function to the store, for one thing. Shortly after the arrival of free trials for some more titles, Google is rolling out an option to join a friend's game without an invite. A support page spotted by 9to5Google notes that the option is available in select games, including Far Cry 6. You can switch it on by going to the privacy tab of the Stadia settings. In the Current Game section, there's an option called Join your current game, which you can enable to let others join a multiplayer game without an invitation. You can set this to friends, your friends and their friends, all players or no one. This is a welcome update that brings Stadia a little more in line with other gaming platforms. It could encourage groups of friends to pick up the same games since it'll be a little easier for them to play together.

       "  \"Council tax hikes announced in the recent budget could deal another blow to households Losers of five of their last six games, the Toronto Raptors have been dealt another blow with star forward OG Anunoby picking up a hip injury. He's due to miss at least the team’s next game against the Utah Jazz, and likely several more. Head coach Nick Nurse told reporters on Thursday that Anunoby suffered a hip pointer in practice earlier this week and could be out for “a while.” He was initially ruled as “questionable” for the game against the Jazz, but has now been ruled out as the severity of the injury is more clear. According to sportsmd.com, “\\u200b\\u200ba hip pointer is a contusion, or bruise, of the iliac crest, the bone along the brim of the pelvis, and its surrounding structures.” In 15 games this season, the 24-year-old is averaging 20.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game, while shooting 43 percent from the field and 36.6 percent from three-point range. The London, England native scored 29 points, grabbed six rebounds and snatched three steals, while shooting 6-of-10 from beyond the arc in Toronto’s loss in Portland on Monday. Anunoby has made another step in his development this season, taking on a significant offensive role and leading the team in scoring so far. The Raptors will hope that this time off will only be a hiccup in what is shaping up to be a stellar campaign for the young forward. Precious Achiuwa will also miss Thursday’s game as he deals with a shoulder injury, while Yuta Watanabe has yet to make his season debut.

The Bobcats (3-7, 2-4 Sun Belt) and Eagles (3-7, 2-5) combined for nine punts, three blocked kicks and 17 penalties. Texas State seniors Troy Lefeged Jr. and D.C. Williams both were ejected in the second half for targeting calls and will miss the first half of Saturday's game at Coastal Carolina. With two games left in the season, Texas State cannot win the six games needed to qualify for a bowl invitation. “A very frustrating loss, to be honest with you,” Texas State coach Jake Spavital said. “How that game played out is probably one of the more bizarre games I’ve been a part of. Just like how the whole flow of everything went. At the end of the day, the story of this game is we beat ourselves.” Bobcats quarterback Tyler Vitt completed 29 of 46 passes for 276 yards and an interception; Georgia Southern's Cam Ransom was 7 of 12 for 125 yards and a touchdown. Justin Tomlin came in after Ransom was injured, completing 7 of 13 for 108 yards and a touchdown.

The gaming industry has been mainly focused on entertainment, with only the owners benefit from the market. Users spend lots of time on games without any monetary benefits yet are often denied access to the game until an access token is made. Empire Warriors is incorporated on free-to-play, play-to-earn models and NFT Gaming. Game lovers can now access the game without paying any initial money and still profit from the competition. Figure 1: Empire Warriors, a Revolutionary, Minimalist NFT Card Game That Offers Unique Bonuses with Its Play-To-Earn Business Model Empire Warriors is the first minimalist NFT card game inspired by the play to earn trending era, NFT, and built on blockchain technology. Players must collect cards for themselves, and each card will be a unique parameter that players use to fight in battles. At the same time, each card will have an ID code on the blockchain system along with the owner\\'s identity. Based on this technology, players can safely exchange, buy and sell virtual assets with each other. These transactions are all recorded by the system.

       "  \" (Bloomberg) -- The Netflix Inc. hit Squid Game may be a big win for South Korea’s entertainment industry, but it has also exposed the country’s darker side to a global audience. Most Read from Bloomberg A Deep Dive Into Squid Game's World of Inequality Hamburg Is at the Heart of Germany’s Growing Dilemma Over China One of California’s Wealthiest Counties Could Run Out of Water Next Summer The Coming Electric Car Disruption That Nobody’s Talking About Meet Six People Fighting Water Scarcity Across the Globe Decades of super-charged growth have left a deeply stratified society, where soaring house prices and a lack of social mobility fuel excessive borrowing. Discrimination against women, the elderly and migrant workers are deeply entrenched and many younger people find life such a grind they're giving up all together. Amid the shocking violence and eerie aesthetic that has made the series Netflix’s biggest launch ever, Squid Game’s depiction of desperate contestants betting their lives to win 45.6 billion won ($39.1 million) while super-rich VIPs watch on contains many realistic moments true to Koreans’ everyday struggles. Here’s a scene-by-scene guide (warning, spoilers throughout) to some of those issues: Yawning Inequality “Prices are crazy these days, this isn’t enough for anything.” The reaction from Seong Gi-hun, the show’s gambling addict protagonist, to his mother giving him 20,000 won ($17) encapsulates life for the have-nots in a country where inequality is worse than in Japan, Australia and Spain. The exchange takes place in their semi-basement home in Ssangmun Dong, the northern neighborhood of Seoul that is in direct geographic and economic opposition to the affluent Gangnam area. These cramped flats built half below ground level, where the characters of the 2020 Oscar-winning film Parasite also live, have become the last resort for Korea’s underclass as apartment prices have surged 70% in the past five years, pushing the average price of an apartment in Seoul beyond $1 million. The so-called ‘banjiha’ homes have proliferated since the 1970s after the government required all low-rise buildings to have basements as bunker spaces, in case of a military threat from the North.\",\n",

       "  'Raoul Pal defended millennials who like meme stocks and crypto and defy typical investing advice. The former Goldman Sachs executive noted that young investors don\\'t care what Wall Street says. Pal suggested investing will be driven by a shift in interest towards technology. Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager and the current CEO of Real Vision TV, defended the millennial investors who have piled into cryptocurrencies and meme stocks in defiance of conventional investing strategies. In a Twitter thread on Sunday, Pal laid out that factors like \"debts, no savings, no hope from the grind\" have made this new generation of investors feel hopeless and skeptical of traditional investing. \"Unlike their parents in their 30s, they didn\\'t get gifted equities with a P/E (price-earnings ratio) of 7, bond yields at 13% or real estate at the lows versus income,\" he said. \"They got the opposite. Their opportunity set was an expected negative future return. They didn\\'t want any part of our financial system.\" A P/E ratio as low as 7 would represent an extremely cheap valuation for many public companies. The average P/E for the S&P 500 rose above 20 in May 2020, its highest valuation in 18 years. A clear pattern emerged in markets this year. During one of the most volatile periods in history, and against a backdrop of increasing social influence, inexperienced investors rushed to invest in stocks with little understanding or concern for the fundamentals of the businesses behind them, or the risks of holding them. \"They had occupied Wall St and no one gave a shit. Now they don\\'t give a shit about how you or I think you should invest or run markets. We let them down,\" Pal said. While some responsibility certainly lies with the investor, zero-commission apps like Robinhood played a part in making it seem like the risks of investing were minimized. In defiance of hedge funds and investing norms, and in response to inflationary triggers, Wall Street found itself dealing with two trading frenzies: meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The rewards for winning are Smooth Love Potion or SLPs, a fungible cryptocurrency. As they play, players can cash out their in-game winnings and exchange them for their local fiat currency, earning real money for playing the game. Axie Infinity is developed by Vietnam-based company Sky Mavis and was first released in 2018. As the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns spread around the world, many industries were effectively shut down, leaving millions of people unemployed. In this global context, the popularity of Axie Infinity has soared, with over a million players registered as of August 2021. The largest number of Axie Infinity players and scholarship holders are from the Philippines. To get started with the game, players need a team of three Axies. These Axies are not simply cute digital creatures, they are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

The corrosive nature of hockey culture has been exposed throughout the past year, and it’s no different at the high school level, unfortunately. During a Thursday game between Pittsburgh-area Armstrong High School and Mars Hockey Club, a number of Armstrong students participated in sexually explicit chants directed at a female goaltender on the Mars team, leaving the unnamed goaltender in tears. As a subsequent result of the chants, all Armstrong students have been banned from attending hockey games, while the students who allegedly participated in the chants may face further disciplinary action. “In my mind, this should’ve been stopped immediately by anyone that was there who has any moral value at all. I’m disgusted by it. … There were a lot of people there who could’ve handled this differently,” Armstrong principal Kirk Lorigan said via Mike White of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Mars head coach Steve Meyers said the player that was targeted is the only goaltender on the roster, while noting that she has been the starter for all of the team’s five games this season. “We have no one else. She plays varsity and JV for us. We’ve had plenty of girls in this league before and never heard anything like this. With all the training we’re required to do as coaches about safe sports and sportsmanship, this should not happen. For it to fail this badly, it’s really disappointing.” Below is a video of the vulgar chant directed from the Armstrong students, and we don’t necessarily advise watching it. It’s become all too commonplace for the pervasive nature of abuse and sexual harassment to rear its ugly head in hockey, and this is yet another incident within the sport where hockey has failed to protect its most vulnerable actors.\\xa0 We can only hope that the victim finds some peace, while those who participated in this gross chant are swiftly punished.

By tackling a game design challenge that has never been executed before, the newly launched interactive and blockchain-based game - built on Solana - is reinventing and reimagining how gamers act, via unique and distinct NFTs that evolve based on the actions of players. Unlike traditional mobile game artists who have the luxury of designing a finite set of characters, Genopets delivered a spirit animal that is a unique reflection of every player by approaching the design via sophisticated 3D models (as opposed to standard JPEGs) that allow the art to become more beautiful as players interact, in effect allowing Genopet NFT\\'s to accrue value based on distinctive, idiosyncratic personalization. \"Our team has meticulously created an anatomical design system that allows for a massive range of permutations so that each Genopet can be unique to each player,\" said Benjamin Tse, CPO and Co-Founder of Genopets. \"Genopets are designed to be completely modular and are procedurally generated and upgraded to evolve as players interact with the game, essentially allowing users to become virtual graphic artists in their own right.\" \"We are thrilled to be working alongside the Genopets team and the innovation behind the move-to-earn ecosystem will create more demand in the NFT space and excitement for digital assets,\" said CAH CEO James Zhang. \"This game epitomizes the promise of Web 3.0, and of the thousands of games that we have been involved with this concept is particularly exciting and we can only imagine how enticing it will be to users.\" The number of permutations Genopets is building is in the millions highlighting the sheer volume of work required to scale, deliver, and execute the creation of a unique spirit animal with 12 different body',\n",

The Polkadot network is a \"game changing\" viable alternative to Ethereum according to research published by EQONEX Labs. Claire Zhao, Blockchain Researcher from EQONEX Labs, has \"high hopes\" for the performance of the network saying it offers the \"perfect trifecta of solutions\": blockchain interoperability, decentralized governance, and scalability. \"We\\'re excited to make the token available for trading through a DOT/USDC pairing,\" said Richard Byworth, CEO of the Nasdaq-listed crypto ecosystem EQONEX Group. USD and USDC are fully fungible on the platform meaning that USD holders can purchase DOT using the USDC market. The complexity in the Polkadot protocol\\'s design has created challenges for traders with very few custodians able to provide safe storage of the coin, and some other exchanges have had to indeed freeze withdrawals as the protocol pushes changes through. EQONEX Group custodian Digivault is pleased to have solved these technical challenges and will provide safe custody and exchange services for DOT. \"The beauty of trading Polkadot on the EQONEX exchange is the default custody in Digivault\", said Robert Cooper, CEO at Digivault. The new DOT listing follows the announcement that Digivault, EQONEX Group\\'s crypto custodian, became the first custodian registered by the UK\\'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to provide secure custody services for DOT. \"We\\'ve listed this token due to its contribution to solving the problems of being able to offer interoperability, decentralisation and scalability simultaneously. Polkadot has also designed a ground-breaking blockchain protocol which allows for communication between different blockchains that are then connected, from a security and governance perspective by the core \\'Relay Chain\\',\" Mr. Byworth said. Mr. Byworth noted he expected a high level of interest and activity on the exchange amongst both traders and longer-term investors given recent research that has demonstrated that for institutional investors DOT is the most widely held crypto asset after BTC and ETH.

Recently, both Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) rocked their shareholders by releasing third quarter results that fell well short of expectations. Yet the platforms have potentially gained major volume boosts during the current quarter, making it a good time to ask which ones are winning the crypto exchange game this year. Most cryptocurrency exchanges don't report earnings because they aren't public companies, but a new study by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, reveals a bit about what it takes to get ahead in this competitive trading segment. Over the past year, crypto exchanges on a growth path shared a few common traits: they're larger, more innovative and offer more digital assets than their competitors. Based on that criteria, bigger players like Binance, Coinbase and FTX are at or near the top of crypto trading's league table, Chainalysis found. According to Chainanalysis data, the landscape of crypto exchanges has been shrinking since July 2020. And, as in other sectors, the consolidation has been characterized by larger players increasingly growing their businesses faster than smaller counterparts.\\xa0\\xa0 By tracing value sent to more than 1500 crypto exchanges over the past year, the study divided exchanges into different segments based on business model and size. Those segments included over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges, high risk exchanges (HRE), centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and derivatives exchanges. Crypto exchanges by business model Over-the-counter (OTC) brokers like Circle, ItBit and Genesis Trading provide a more personal touch for higher spending customers. This type of exchange service happens behind closed doors, and caters to investors intent on buying and selling large amounts of cryptocurrency — meaning they need a lot of liquidity. Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges, on the other hand, serve the easiest way for the unbanked to trade.

Announced a couple months back, this $50 gadget is very similar physically to last year\\'s Mario Game & Watch, the first in the series based on Nintendo\\'s pre-Game Boy line of handhelds. The only difference is the addition of the start and select buttons, which are actually used in the Zelda games. The games themselves are the inimitable original, The Legend of Zelda; its brutally hard side-scrolling sequel The Adventure of Link; and cherished puzzle box classic Link\\'s Awakening, recently remade in style. There\\'s also a recreation of a classic monochrome Game & Watch from the \\'80s, though its entertainment value is, frankly, limited. You can play each straight through, or hit the Game button to switch to another, saving your progress. There are no save states beyond that, though, so get ready to die a gazillion times in Zelda II. The display is nothing fancy but matches the game resolution well, looking as clear as can be expected at that size. It\\'s definitely harder to play on this handheld than on a TV but very doable. For the record, these close-up pictures show more pixelation than you notice when playing, there\\'s definitely no screen door effect as you see in the shot below.

The firm’s stock was up more prominent than 3% after the report. Revenue: $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion anticipated. “The third quarter was outstanding, with record revenue,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.” Earnings per share: $1.17 versus $1.11 anticipated. Data Center income: $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion anticipated. Gaming income: $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion anticipated. But Nvidia, like other chipmakers, has also been stung by the chip shortage. The company’s consumer graphics cards are incredibly scarce thanks to a run on them by both cryptominers and resellers using bots to grab as many cards as possible. As a result, cards are selling for hundreds of dollars above their manufacturer’s suggested retail price. Cards that should cost $599 are going for well north of $1,000, and finding any near their original prices is a pointless endeavor. Nvidia still makes the majority of its cash on its games business, but the company’s data center arm has become increasingly important to the company’s future.

Doctors say that while antiviral pills provide promising treatment options, they should be considered as supplements to vaccines rather than alternatives. “Getting vaccinated still must be at the heart of [the U.S.’s COVID-19] strategy, as a therapeutic pill is not a substitute for getting vaccinated,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, told\\xa0ABC News on Sunday.

That’s my ending.” Earlier this month, James, in an post-press-conference exchange with Lakers teammate Anthony Davis that was recorded and shared by an Orange County Register reporter, said he finished “Squid Game” but hated the final scene in which protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) decides to not get on a plane to the U.S. to see his daughter and leaves the airport to apparently track down the mysterious organizers of the deadly Squid Game. “I didn’t like the ending though. What are you doing?” James says the clip. “Get on the flight and see your fucking daughter.” Hwang told the Guardian that if James has a “Squid Game” ending “that would satisfy him, maybe he could make his own sequel. I’ll check it out and maybe send him a message saying, ‘I liked your whole show, except the ending.’” James kept the pseudo-feud going, reacting to Hwang’s comments on Twitter in mock disbelief. “This can’t be real right??!! I hope not,” King James tweeted, followed by 10 laughing emoji. Netflix hasn’t yet officially announced a Season 2 order for “Squid Game,” although that seems all but certain. The show has become Netflix’s biggest-ever TV show, at least based on the streamer’s metric that counts number of households who access a given title for at least 2 minutes. The company said 142 million member households — about two-thirds of all subscribers — sampled “Squid Game” in its first four weeks of release, a new record.

Singapore, Nov. 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (via Blockchain Wire) HeliconNFT has launched its cross-dimensional gaming ecosystem that enables users to monetise in-game assets. In-game elements move fluidly across different platforms and networks, bridging the gap between centralised games and blockchain. Decentralised governance includes content creation opportunities, forwarding motions for community voting and worldwide tournaments. Photo Available: Roadshow In HeliconNFT, the brand-new, global, gaming-focused NFT ecosystem, unique items and elements from different games can flow freely across platforms to be purchased, sold, or traded. This means players can come together as one community and monetise their in-game assets across different games. “In the briefest possible definition, what we’re building is a powerful, high-level, cross-dimensional gaming ecosystem that ultimately rewards its users. We’ve built a world where our users can enter a global ecosystem and play, mine, and, most importantly, earn money,” explains Tom Palmer, Chief Product Officer of HeliconNFT. “You can imagine the number of people involved to make the vision of this ecosystem a reality. There was a real sense of joy and achievement in finalising this creative effort. As this game reaches the masses, we look forward to continuing to create and develop conditions to further expand upon this metaverse and bring additional rewards and benefits to our users,” he adds. Photo Available: Roadmap Exploring the Ecosystem The HeliconNFT ecosystem is built on three distinguishing characteristics, namely increasing the liquidity of NFTs, developing a bespoke Helicon token and the universe of the game itself. Of these, Agora – where players can increase NFT liquidity – is the crux and is designed around four key pillars. At the tip of the spear is the Helicon Liquidity Yield Aggregator. As one of the core goals of HeliconNFT is to increase the liquidity of NFTs, nine liquidity pools are available for mining. These are the primary source for NFTs, or, as they’re known within the game, Helicon Drachma Tokens',\n",

The report led Tencent Holdings Ltd. as much as 3.5% higher, with NetEase Inc. adding 6.8%. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the biggest technology firms in China, gained 1.9% and was set for the highest close in three weeks. In Tokyo Nexon Co., which gets 28% of its revenue from China, surged 6.3%, while Koei Tecmo Holdings Co., which has worked with Tencent on mobile games, added 3.9%, the most in two months.

It shows that the peak of the overall regulation crackdown is behind us.” China was said to slow game approvals to enforce stricter rules earlier this year, asking developers to re-submit titles with new protections for kids.

Therefore, the new community that joins the Crypto market with a modest amount of capital, they often have special interest in Meme coins. The idea of RICI Elon was to create a meme token that would have exponential growth in value. As you hold onto the token longer, your assets grow faster and stronger with time due to its built-in hyper deflationary mechanism. Even more, by using RICI tokens to participate in the SafeMEME game, players have more incentive to hold as long as possible in order to receive huge profits in the end! RICI Elon is one of the Meme projects that are \"crazy\" when their tokens are planned to be burned 99.99% at launch. Really crazy! They don\\'t even organize public crowdfunding events from IDO or IEO. More than that, to boost the community to the moon, a tax of 10% is applied to all transactions with 5% of the tax will be distributed fairly to all RICI holders. And the other 5% of the transaction tax will be automatically added to the Liquidity pool to generate an ever-rising price floor. RICI Elon is giving out free tokens through the Airdrop program to grow their loyal community, and active members can earn up to 50% in referral rewards. The project has gained impressive attraction from the very first days. The community grew to more than 50,000 holders in just 72 hours.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the world\\'s most trusted solution to power and protect digital experiences, today released new research into the evolving threat landscape for application programming interfaces (APIs), which according to Gartner will be the most frequent online attack vector by 2022. The report, \\'API: The Attack Surface That Connects Us All,\\' is the latest from Akamai\\'s State of the Internet / Security report series. The new report also features a collaboration between Akamai and Veracode researchers, including a guest essay written by Chris Eng, Chief Research Officer at Veracode. APIs are inherently designed to be fast and easy pipelines between different platforms. While this priority on convenience and user experience leads APIs to be highly essential to many businesses, it also makes them appealing targets for cybercriminals. Akamai\\'s report highlights the frustrating patterns of API vulnerabilities, despite the improvements that have been made in Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs) and testing tools. Often, API security is relegated to an afterthought in the rush to bring them to market, with many organizations relying on traditional network security solutions that are not designed to protect the wide attack surface that APIs can introduce. \"From broken authentication and injection flaws, to simple misconfigurations, there are numerous API security concerns for anyone building an internet-connected application,\" said Steve Ragan, Akamai security researcher and author of the State of the Internet / Security report. \"API attacks are both underdetected and underreported when detected. While DDoS attacks and ransomware are both major issues, attacks on APIs don\\'t receive the same level of attention, in large part because criminals use APIs in ways that lack the splash of a well-executed ransomware attack, but that doesn\\'t mean they should be ignored.\" It\\'s not always clear where API vulnerabilities live.

Beverly Hills, Oct. 20, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ken Mahar supports business owners with a powerful tool: email marketing. He’s helping them reach and serve their customers more effectively through his full-service email marketing agency, Email Broadcast.   Listen to the full interview of Ken Mahar with Adam Torres on Mission Matters.   How did Email Broadcast get its start?  Mahar started using email marketing personally as a sales tool helping him rise to the top of a high-tech firm’s sales team. After seeing the power of email marketing first hand, he pitched some previous employers on letting him handle their email marketing for them. This was met with huge success, eventually forcing him to make a choice between his side gig and his sales position—and he’s never looked back. “Learning the craft of sales helped me understand the value of consistent contact with prospects and previous customers and led me to found Email Broadcast,” Mahar says. “Understanding the steps of the sale, relating product details in a meaningful way, handling objections, strategizing, dealing with competition, and practicing it all consistently is the key to achieve tenfold excellence in marketing.” Mahar now applies those sales skills for the benefit of his clients’ email campaigns. How has email marketing evolved in the last few years? “It’s funny how in the last 20 years of my exposure to the email marketing industry, I’ve seen huge changes, but also realize that many of the same challenges still exist. You’re still fighting for attention,” Mahar notes. “People thought email marketing would die in the wake of new platforms. Turns out, a major percentage of business communications still happen via email. The big dirty secret is that companies are still underinvesting in their email marketing.” The biggest change Ken sees is how tech innovations and advancements like professional ESPs (email service providers) have made email marketing much easier than it used to be to get started... but more difficult to master because the platforms are so',\n",

A 500-square-metre (598-square-yard) garment factory in the Seongbuk district of the capital Seoul was humming this week, green and pink thread flying off stacked spools off serger machines with loud knocking noises in a race to meet orders. \"October is usually a slow month for the sewing industry, but thanks to Squid Game and Halloween, we are scrambling to stitch,\" factory owner Kim jin-ja, 54, told Reuters. \"We are now sewing 6,000 teal-green tracksuits for toddlers and children.\" Kim says her annual sales of 1.5 billion won ($1.27 million) plummeted to a third of what she used to make after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Most of her orders came from Japan but travel restrictions forced her to shut down in August and September. She now hopes orders will last past Halloween and sees better chances of renewed exports with \"Made in Korea\" labels. The South Korean garment industry had been in decline even before the pandemic with higher wage levels making it difficult to compete with China, Vietnam or Indonesia.

After all, even as the S&P 500 Index more than doubled in the past five years, Bitcoin rocketed more than 80-fold -- albeit with much of the rally occurring in the past year. “Memecoins” such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also surged, often for no particular reason. Big gains aren’t a given, though, especially in a market as untamed, sprawling and speculative as crypto. And the inflation in value is often ephemeral. For evidence, there’s Squid Game, or SQUID, the latest memecoin sensation, inspired by the Netflix hit. It surged more than 230,000% in the past week to $2,861.80, according to CoinMarketCap pricing -- only to plunge 100% to less than half a cent as of Monday in New York. “Betting on the right coin can lead to jaw-dropping riches,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, in an email Sunday. “The problem is, what goes up in a straight line tends to retreat in a similar fashion.” He added, “you hear that some memecoin investors don’t care about the losses. They are in it for the ride,” but that “once the selling starts, a cascading effect can play out, so it’s wise to only use money you can afford to lose.” Some digital assets have had eye-popping gains, with the past year’s bull market spreading beyond the likes of Bitcoin and Ether to other tokens, decentralized finance projects and more. Dogecoin, which started in 2013 as a joke, has soared 10,000% in the past year, according to CoinGecko pricing.

In a roller coaster of a game, the Seminoles jumped out to a big early lead, saw it slip through their fingers and then responded with two straight scoring drives to beat the Hurricanes 31-28 for their first win over UM since 2016. With how the game played out, there are quite a few moments that could be looked at as game-changing plays that turned the tide one way or the other. Here's that list narrowed down to just three plays that tell the story of FSU's streak-snapping win over Miami. As is to be expected in games like this, this story will have a heavy focus on the game-winning drive. The play that will be remembered from this comeback will undoubtedly be the fourth and 14 conversion from Jordan Travis to Andrew Parchment (more on that in a bit). But that play likely never would have happened were it not such an incredible start to the Seminoles' game-winning drive. FSU got lucky that a great punt from Miami's Lou Hedley rolled into the end zone and wasn't downed deep in FSU territory. Had FSU been pinned deep by a punt that landed at the 16-yard line and rolled all the way into the end zone, what followed would likely have been different.

Seen during the late 1970's as a passing trend at best and a joke at worst, fifty years later with a global annual penetration of $152 billion and growing, no one is laughing. Recent innovations in the sector such as Virtual and Augmented Reality, as well as the evolution of mobile phones - and by extension, mobile gaming - has pushed the envelope farther than anyone thought possible. The meteoric rise in mobile gaming specifically has led to the deployment of undeniably the most successful business model ever utilized by mobile games companies - Free-To-Play (FTP). These style of games are still in relative infancy (appearing only 10 years ago) but have already become market leaders, steering the industry ever since their inception. League Of Ancients FTP models earn income by allowing players to use real-world money to instantly unlock extra features, known as microtransactions. Through this process, customers can purchase new player designs, infinite retries or special items, pay to skip a level or even remove bothersome adverts. Because players are already enjoying the game for free, spending money on perks is an acceptable cost in the value for money equation, and therefore the model is extremely efficient, generating vast income for the companies who created them. However, now with the rise of cryptocurrency, an extra model is being added to the roster with immense early success. Play-To-Earn. PTE is exactly as it sounds. These cryptocurrency (or GameFi as they are otherwise known) titles allow individuals to earn cryptocurrencies simply by playing the game.

       "  'STOCKHOLM, Nov. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- GSB Gold Standard Pay KB, Sweden: The future of the financial sector is currently being explored worldwide against the backdrop of the fabulous digital hype! Decentralised digital networks, which are summarised under the term \"DeFi\", promise a more transparent and, above all, more efficient financial system. DeFi\" stands for \"decentralised finance\" and is based on the database technology blockchain. An essential component here are automatically executed contracts, so-called \"smart contracts\". The goal is a decentralised system that works without intermediaries. In so-called DeFi applications, this task is taken over by the network of participants, which follows the \"rules of the game\" in the protocol. As a rule, this is a blockchain protocol that enables a decentralised organisation through so-called smart contracts.Smart contracts are digital contracts that are embedded in programme code and can thus replace human or manual transactions. These decentralised applications, abbreviated as dApps, make it possible to present the same services in the financial sector as we are used to from classic financial intermediaries. This can be, in particular, the trading of securities or the granting and drawing down of loans. Most DeFi applications are currently based on the best-known smart contract platform Ethereum. Tokens are used so that such a decentralised ecosystem can control itself. These tokens can be used to coordinate network decisions as well as to set incentives for operating the decentralised service. DeFi protocols have one thing in common: their main use case is based on lending and borrowing. Specifically, tokens are lent in exchange for profits. So instead of doing a transaction in the traditional way, the network itself handles the transactions based on the decentralised credit protocol. The standard case here is that you \"log in\" tokens that you own for allocation. This means that you make your tokens available to other participants. In return, you receive profits on your loaned tokens. In contrast to centralised crypto exchange platforms, decentralised exchange platforms, so-called DEX, never have access to the assets of the traders. Since there is no central instance which can be hacked or whose prices',\n",

Photo cards of BTS members will be released as NFTs on Upbit, which would be available to share on virtual spaces. Physical photo cards are commonly released in limited quantities and collected and traded by fans who meet in person. “We are working with Dunamu to create a way to expand the fan experience,” said Hybe founder Bang Si-hyuk in an online briefing.

Aside from the NFT announcement, Hybe also plans to launch original stories starring members of its K-pop boy bands from January, which will be released in web cartoon and web novel format via Naver Webtoon Co.’s platform.

It was sold as a way to play an upcoming online game based on the series. Squid launched in late October and saw its price surge in the last few days. It went from one cent to as high as around $2,800, before plunging to $0 on Monday. Its website disappeared, along with every other social media presence, and its Twitter account, which had gained 57,000 followers, was blocked due to “unusual activity”. “Squid Game Dev does not want to continue running the project,” the developers wrote on their Telegram channel, saying they were “depressed” by scammers and “overwhelmed with stress.” \"The value of Squid Game meme coin becoming null in a matter of minutes is a classic portrayal of superficial value maximisation,\" Kunal Sawhney, CEO at equities research firm Kalkine Group told Yahoo Finance UK. \"Such movements are exceptionally bizarre as people are increasingly tilting towards these unregulated instruments without actually knowing the underlying value behind them,\" he said.

And if you thought those consoles were hard to get before, as our own Ihsaan Fanusie pointed out, buckle up, because, according to at least one industry analyst, the system makers are expected to sell some 3.34 million fewer units this calendar year than previous estimates indicated — dropping the total expected sales from 44.3 million to 40.9 million. “There's been a reduction in 2021 of shipments in my model from July to November that's down about 3.34 million units,” IDC research director of gaming Lewis Ward told Yahoo Finance. That expected reduction in sales, a result of the ongoing chip shortage, means that a year after the consoles launched, gamers will still have a hard time getting their calloused thumbs on them. And that's unlikely to end any time soon. With the ongoing supply chain crisis and global chip shortage, experts have generally advised that the best way to get what you need this holiday season is to buy as early as possible. And while that might work for things like sneakers, pots and pans, and bicycles, game consoles have been in short supply year round. Ever since they launched in November 2020, the Series X and PS5 have been incredibly difficult to find. According to Mat Piscatella, video game advisor at NPD Group, both consoles are selling at historic or near historic rates. “When compared to historical benchmarks, supply has been good. PlayStation 5 has been the fastest selling PlayStation to date, and the Xbox Series is very close to being the fastest selling Xbox,” he said. “However, while at this point in previous cycles hardware was more widely\",\n",

By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, POCOLAND has access to high-quality, tamper-proof market data needed to get the real-time price of BUSD and BNB for the NFT Marketplace. Now, users can securely purchase characters, equipment, and other items using BUSD and BNB as their collateral, with each transaction backed by highly accurate and reliable conversion rates.

We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading DeFi protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and data manipulation attacks via flash loans. The Poco NFT Marketplace is where players can mint and trade assets such as characters, equipment, and other in-game items.

Since we wanted our game to be fair for all users, we integrated Chainlink VRF's RNG for provably random minting to help ensure that the rarest Pocos are distributed fairly according to probability. When developing our NFT marketplace, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner so that our users could purchase items, equipment, and characters with multiple different assets.

The company has become a meme focus and nearly doubled in price in the past few trading days.  Figure 2: OCGN stock sentiment on WSB. Swaggy Stocks The most likely catalyst behind the price surge is the anticipated World Health Organization’s approval of COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. Ocugen is a co-development partner with Bharat Biotech on the drug, and it holds the rights to commercialize Covaxin in North America. Recent stage 3 results showed the drug to be efficient even against the delta variant, which could help in the approval process in these countries. Meanwhile, the stock is a bear target. OCGN has 56 million shares shorted, representing a whopping 29% of the float. While heavy shorting signals skepticism and caution, it can also put shares on the edge of a short squeeze — if or once massive buying volume takes place.

Every other week, a new blockchain-based game or feature is announced that shows that it is truly here to stay in the gaming sector with only more progress to be made. This union of blockchain and gaming is an understandable one as there is often an overlap between blockchain lovers and gamers and many blockchain features, such as NFTs, work well with a gaming landscape. However, for blockchain to truly take its place in the gaming world, a collective and deliberate effort needs to be taken to discover, launch, and support these games. This, thankfully, is on its way to being addressed through a new initiative called Iron Sail, which was announced recently. Setting Sail As per the official announcement, Iron Sail is “ A collective effort to contribute to the development of the blockchain gaming space.” As such, Iron Sail will work to bring together players in the blockchain space to discover and support in the gaming sauce. This will be done through collaboration and financial support of these games. Thus far, Iron Sail has discovered 7 treasures - 7 promising blockchain games with over $25 million raised from top-tier investors and partners including Kardia Ventures, Morningstar Ventures, Eternity Ventures, Bitscale, Formless Capital, Youbi, Axia 8 Ventures, Polkastarter, Good Guild Game, Mask Network. Iron Sail aims to make blockchain game development more accessible and sustainable. Accessibility, in this case, means helping game developers to employ blockchain technology, and providing investors with amazing opportunities. Sustainability means supporting developers committed to a long-term plan, and building a “game before gain” community as gamers and content creators are the core. Iron Sail is working toward the open metaverse - an interconnected future, where everyone and everything is linked together and the online-offline experience is converged.

According to LinkedIn, U.S. job postings for “crypto” and “blockchain” positions have skyrocketed 615% in August, compared to the same period last year. “We’re seeing this across the big banks and that’s really the sea change over the past few years,” Devin Banerjee, LinkedIn’s editor-at-large of business and finance, told Yahoo Finance. “Big banks were the ones kind of hesitant and scratching their heads over adoption of cryptocurrency and the need for crypto talent, but now they’re getting in the game.” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon publicly expressed his doubts about bitcoin (BTC-USD), the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.17 trillion, as recently as last month in an interview, calling it “a little bit of fool’s gold” that has “no intrinsic value,” that regulators would “regulate the hell out of.” Yet despite Dimon’s skepticism, the bank started offering clients access to half a dozen crypto funds in July. Crypto talent hiring by major financial services firms rose 40% in the first half 2021, compared to the same period last year, according to LinkedIn data. The site projects these firms are on pace to add more than three times as many workers with experience in digital assets to their payrolls in 2021 than they did in 2015.

With the emergence of a new coin based on the wildly successful Netflix\\'s \"Squid Game\" series, Shiba Inu\\'s explosive price action has sparked a debate about which of these emerging coins are legitimate investments, and which are scams.

According to Bank of America data that tracks social media crypto trends, Reddit/Twitter token mentions put Shiba Inu and Dogecoin among the top 5 for October with the largest month over month change in mentions.\\xa0 Yet not everyone is on board. “I’d prefer to stay away from any of that stuff,” Geoff Golberg, a crypto investor and CEO of social analytics firm, Social Forensics, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\\xa0 Golberg, who got into cryptocurrencies in 2015, isn’t nearly as excited by Shiba Inu or Dogecoin as other retail buyers. “I’m interested in cryptocurrency for the long term,” he said.\\xa0 On the one hand, Golberg suggested these “meme coins” serve as a way to get more people interested in cryptocurrency, because they’re fun and enticing.\\xa0 Still, the other side of a skyrocketing trade like Shiba could easily spell disaster. “A lot of people are going to get burnt and maybe that will leave them with a sour taste for crypto,” Golberg added. Currently Shiba Inu is worth a fraction of a cent, 5 decimal places from a single dollar, ($0.00007336 to be exact).

New York, Nov. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Serious Games Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06184962/?utm_source=GNW  The application of serious games in end-user industries for purposes such as education, training, problem recognition, enhanced problem-solving capabilities, social skills, and improving collaborative abilities, along with decision making, is considered to have potential benefits. Key Highlights Enterprise gaming systems are expected to witness substantial growth during the forecast period. Organizations have shown a heavy inclination toward collaborative systems, which do not create a competitive environment, as they are widely considered counterproductive. For instance, Mint.com Company successfully experimented with gaming to drive high-profiled leads. ? These systems are also used for employee training, as the use of gaming by SAP to educate their employees on sustainability. Advanced technologies are influencing the financial services industry to adopt serious gaming as well. The aim is to reduce the complexity involved in simulation training across investment decision-making. This is made possible by making the offers and products intuitive. Also, the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to witness a significant growth rate of 25.38% in the market studied. Asia-Pacific has also been a significant adopter of technological advancements. The market studied in the developing economies poses a key opportunity in implementing these solutions. The vendors in the market studied have been offering new and better games that are targeted toward education purposes irrespective of users’ age. For example, Fiscal Ship, which was selected as one of the best educational apps to game during the pandemic by the New York Post, challenges players of all ages to put the federal budget on a sustainable course.

Subscribe Wednesday, October 20, 2021 To understand why Netflix’s (NFLX) third quarter results completely obliterated market expectations in the face of a festering public relations firestorm, it’s perhaps best to connect a few abstruse ideas. In the space of a month, the streaming behemoth has (in their words, not mine) “pierced the cultural zeitgeist.” It managed to do so not once but twice: via its dystopian drama “Squid Game” — a runaway global hit topping Netflix’s charts in 94 countries and drawing in 142 million households — and Dave Chappelle’s polarizing comedy special, “The Closer,” that stands accused of transphobia. The Chappelle imbroglio has become something of a culture war Rorschach test, which we needn’t delve into in this space — at least not today.\\xa0 However, it’s worth noting that, despite more than a week of bad press, Netflix’s stock is comfortably perched within shouting distance of a 52-week high at $646.84 — and Wall Street is as bullish as its ever been even though the “stay-at-home” phase of the pandemic is gone (hopefully for good). According to Bank of Montreal, which has a $700 price target on the stock, near-term catalysts driving the stock include “new and returning original content that drives critical and audience word of mouth/social media recognition.” And Bank of America, which sees the stock hitting $680 in the near term, cited data showing worldwide cancellations actually fell in Q3 when compared to Q2. All of that matters, because like it or not, Netflix’s constituency is literally all of Planet Earth where each region and its occupants see the world in starkly differing terms. Not only is the \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) real, it drives eyeballs to the platform, regardless of controversies. The streamer now has “hit series in Latin America, in India, in local markets. They have the mind share and market share in those areas,” Manhattan Venture Partners\\' Santosh Rao told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. “What',\n",

The company's gaming head Phil Spencer has revealed that Forza Horizon 5 had the best launch day of any Xbox Game Studios title. There have been over 4.5 million people playing the arcade racer across all platforms (Xbox, Windows and cloud) to date, and its peak concurrent players were three times those of its predecessor. Horizon 5 is enjoyable, as you might have gathered from our hands-on, but it also helps that the game had one of Microsoft's widest releases yet. The new Forza launched simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, the Microsoft Store on Windows and through Steam. It's much easier to pick up the game this time around, and it's a major showcase for both Microsoft's latest consoles as well as PCs with high-end video cards. All the same, it's a significant moment for Microsoft after years of buying and fostering developers to make Xbox Game Studios a well-known brand. There's a real chance the company will eclipse itself, too, with Halo Infinite poised to launch in less than a month. It's just a question of whether or not these standout launches will translate to better Xbox sales.\",\n",

Epic had announced two weeks ago that it would shut down the Chinese version of the game on November 15, noting that \"Fortnite China\\'s Beta test has reached an end\" and that servers would be closed. Chinese players said they could no longer access the game on Monday, posting goodbyes on social media platform Weibo. A discussion board on the game had been viewed 470 million times. \"It\\'s a pity,\" a user who gave only her surname Ding told AFP. \"I don\\'t understand why it ended so quickly.\" Another player surnamed Zheng, 24, told AFP he would \"first cry for a little\" over the game he had played for more than two years while at university. The move ends a long-running test of Fortnite created for China, where content is policed for excessive violence. The action-packed shooter and world-building game is one of the most popular in the world, boasting more than 350 million users. Its Chinese test version was released in 2018, but \"Fortnite\" never received the government\\'s green light to be formally launched and monetised as approvals for new games slowed.

On Monday, to celebrate Xbox's 20th anniversary, video game studio 343 Industries announced a beta version of Halo Infinite's multiplayer mode would go live for the Xbox Series X and S, as well as Xbox One. The full game, including a campaign featuring the latest adventure from main protagonist Master Chief, will still arrive on Dec. 8. The launch of this beta gives players a first taste of what Microsoft has planned for Halo Infinite online. Halo is among the most popular online games ever, helping to pioneer first-person shooters on video game consoles. I've been playing Infinite since its launch Monday. Here are five things I learned: ►A new free streaming option: Music subscription service Tidal offers its first free tier ►Need to fix your iPhone 12 or 13?: You can soon do it yourself using Apple's Self Service Repair It's been six years since the last Halo game. If you are a fan of shooters and have lived on a steady diet of Call of Duty, Fortnite or others, get ready to adjust how you play. Thanks to all that armor, you can take a lot of damage. It's not uncommon to escape a firefight even if your opponent blindsides you and gets in several hits. Melee matters a lot here for planting a finishing strike on a weakened opponent. If you're going one-on-one with someone in Infinite, there's more back-and-forth in the combat. Coming off playing Call of Duty, I've grown so used to aiming down sights. In Halo, you can hip fire with more accuracy. In some cases, you're better off not pulling down on the left trigger to aim. Is any of this new to Halo? No. But you might find yourself a little rusty if you haven't played Halo in a long time. There's a healthy of mix of everything across the board: tight spaces if you like really close combat, really long views if you enjoy sniping, and massive landscapes where you can\",\n",

Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201.\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\tGME stock could rebound if Q3 sales beat expectations and lead to a better FCF\\t\\t GameStop\\xa0(NYSE:GME) looks like it could be turning the corner financially. In its fiscal second-quarter results released on Sept. 8, sales rose to $1.183 billion from $942 million last year. Moreover, its net income loss was much lower than last year. Investors in GME stock could see a major turnaround sometime within the next year. Moreover, as I pointed out in my article last month, the company’s quarterly net free cash flow (FCF) loss was much lower compared to fiscal Q1. This portends a potential return to positive FCF once its sales levels rise. As a result, GME stock has been rising. For example, since reaching a low of $146.80 per share on Aug. 4, its price has increased dramatically. As of mid-day Nov. 11, GME stock was at $206.61. That represents a rise of more than 40% in the space of just over three months. Moreover, it is now five times higher than the trough point of $40.59 it reached on Feb. 19. The market must be expecting the company’s financial health to start turning around. GameStop probably won’t release its Q3 earnings for the fiscal quarter ending Oct. 31 until the first week of December. However, we can see what the results might be by referring to analysts’ estimates. For example, according to Yahoo! Finance, four analysts predict that the company will lose 52 cents in its fiscal Q3 ending Oct. 31. That compares with a loss of 53 cents last year. However, their sales estimates are for $1.19 billion this quarter compared to just over $1 billion last year. That represents a gain of 18.44% over the past year. Assuming the company can beat these estimates, GME stock could rise further. The reason, as I mentioned earlier, is that the company is very close to becoming FCF positive. Just a slight increase in sales will help it turn the corner. But it’s not as if the company',\n",

Subscribe Thursday, October 28, 2021 Remember that time Elon Musk briefly flirted with the idea of taking Tesla (TSLA) private, partly financed with money from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth war chest, and promptly landed in hot water with regulators? Now that the carmaker has definitively joined the $1 trillion market capitalization club — only the fifth company to do so — the $420, “funding secured” episode may seem like ancient history (it was 2018, for those keeping track at home).\\xa0 But it’s worth the stroll down memory lane now that Tesla is firing on all cylinders, striking huge deals and cowing the short-sellers into submission (Speaking of, what are Jim Chanos and David Einhorn doing with themselves these days?) With all the momentum behind it, could Tesla grow even bigger, to say, $3 trillion? In a recent Substack post, economics commentator James Pethokoukis mused about the idea of Tesla becoming the first company to outflank tech giants. Pethokoukis wrote: Everyone knows America doesn’t make anything anymore. But, you know, Tesla does. And what it makes investors apparently think is pretty valuable, both now and in the future. Indeed, they think the potential of what Tesla makes is so valuable that no company has itself become so valuable despite selling so little. It makes sense that the Information Technology Revolution would make lots of fortunes through the manipulation of bits. But maybe now we are shifting back to wealth creations via the manipulation of atoms — enabled, of course, by IT advances, including forms of AI — rather than our attention spans via social media. Tesla is one example, and more might be on the way. For example: Moderna is a $140 billion company thanks to its success developing mRNA vaccines to counter the coronavirus. One wonders about the economic potential of new genetic editing techniques… Biology, energy, space. The U.S. economy is about a lot more than tech firms serving us ads while we',\n",

Consequently, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — ended the first week of November gaining 1.4%, 2% and 3.1%, respectively. The robust pace of U.S. economic recovery was reconfirmed despite the pandemic, higher inflationary pressure, prolonged supply-chain disruptions and acute labor shortage. On Nov 3, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also mentioned strong U.S. economic recovery while initiating the tapering of the central’s bank’s quantitative easing program.

Moreover, September’s job additions were revised upward to 312,000 from a disappointing 194,000 reported earlier. August’s data was also revised upward to 483,000 from 366,000 reported earlier.

       "  \" Tesla pushed out a new version of the experimental software suite it calls Full Self-Driving to approved drivers on Oct. 23 through an “over the air” update. The next morning, Tesla learned the update had altered cars' behavior in a way the company's engineers hadn't intended. In a recall report to federal safety regulators Friday, Tesla put the problems like this: The company discovered a software glitch that “can produce negative object velocity detections when other vehicles are present.” In everyday English, Tesla’s automatic braking system was engaging for no apparent reason, causing cars to rapidly decelerate as they traveled down the highway, putting them at risk of being rear-ended. Forward collision warning chimes were ringing too, even though there was no impending collision to warn about. The company said no crashes or injuries were reported due to the glitch. Still, the incident demonstrates how complicated these systems are: Even a small change to one part of the system can affect how something as vital but seemingly simple as automatic braking will function. The incident raises the question of whether there is a safe way to test self-driving vehicles at mass scale on public roads, as Tesla has been doing. Tesla's response to the glitch raises its own concerns. While its engineers worked to fix the software, they turned off automatic braking and forward collision warning for the software testers over the weekend, the company said. According to numerous messages posted on Twitter, owners were not informed that those safety systems had been temporarily deactivated, finding out only by scrolling through the menu on their cars' dashboard screens. By Oct. 25, Tesla had knocked out a software fix and zapped it to 11,704 drivers enrolled in the Full Self-Driving program. Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department, could not be reached for comment. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program is the company's attempt to develop a driverless car. It is markedly different from its driver assist system called Autopilot. The latter, introduced in 2015, automates cruise control, steering and lane changing. Autopilot is the subject of a federal safety investigation\",\n",

Membership of the club doesn’t just earn bragging rights for the likes of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, it also makes the companies hard to ignore for investors well beyond Wall Street. That could bring some welcome stability to shares such as Tesla, further boosting their attraction. The most immediate competition is between Nvidia Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Chipmaker Nvidia is touted to as the big winner in the future of gaming and machine learning, thanks to its market-leading computer graphics card. Tencent, on the other hand, is a bet on China’s high-growth digital economy. While both those stocks need to rise about 60% to make the club, it should be noted that Nvidia has risen more than 75% in four of the last five years. Tencent has been less successful. “Regulation is an uncertainty, but China’s digital economy will continue to grow and Tencent will be part of it,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.

Musk has been telegraphing a potential stock sale because of taxes for months. Even though Tesla shares as dropped about 4.9% in Monday trading, Musk’s tweets about his personal holdings probably aren’t a violation, a securities-law expert said. “He’s acting in his capacity as a shareholder. He could use a Ouija board to decide when to buy and sell shares,” said Jonathan Macey, a professor at Yale Law School. “It’s kind of sad that every time this guy sends out a tweet, people wonder if he’s in trouble with the SEC.” The terms of a settlement agreement with the SEC require that Musk get approval from Tesla’s designated disclosure or securities counsel -- cheekily known as his Twitter Sitter -- before communicating material information to investors. The agreement was amended in April 2019, after Musk clearly ignored it, to require pre-approval for certain categories of posts, including tweets about “events regarding the Company’s securities (including Musk’s acquisition or disposition of the Company’s securities).” But a Twitter poll is just that: a nonbinding theatrical exercise. There’s been no regulatory filing indicating an actual sale. It’s also possible that Musk actually pre-cleared his weekend tweets with Tesla’s designated lawyer.

The NTSB said the driver was operating a 2019 Tesla Model 3 with the driver assistance system Autopilot engaged but was manually pressing the accelerator pedal causing the vehicle to go into override mode when it struck the rear of a minivan. The Tesla then struck a truck at approximately 110 miles per hour and caught fire, resulting in fatal injuries to the Tesla driver and his wife, who was also in the car. The Tesla had issued multiple visual and audible alerts to the 75-year-old driver because his hands were not detected on the steering wheel while using Autopilot. The Tesla was going at about 68 miles per hour behind the minivan when the driver increased the vehicle speed to 72 mph and the Model 3 triggered Automatic Emergency Braking, which dropped the speed. The driver increased pressure on the accelerator to 95%, struck the minivan and then exited the highway traveling at speeds recorded up to 114 mph before striking the pickup. NTSB said the \"investigation was initiated to support the NTSB’s interest in automated vehicle performance\" but after the probe said \"no further action beyond this memorandum will be taken.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Steve Orlofsky) A Marcola man, who was charged with first-degree assault, also called 911 to say his wife shot herself Friday.

The sale equates to about 3% of Musk\\'s total holdings. The options-related part of the sale was put in place in September, well before his Twitter poll. Before the sale, Musk owned a 23% stake in Tesla, including stock options. He also owns other companies including SpaceX.

A huge deal with Hertz buying 100,000 Teslas for its rental fleet, and a big bullish note from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas had shares jumping. But it also follows a big earnings report in the week prior, where Tesla again posted record deliveries of 241,391 in the third quarter, up over 60% from a year ago.

But no matter what your views are of the man, there’s no doubt that his company, Tesla, is poised to change the world. From electric cars and clean energy, the company is pushing the boundaries to come up with innovative solutions for the planet. Tesla shares have been on a tear this year, surging by 66.3% year to date to an all-time high and pushing the market capitalisation of the company past US$1 trillion. The electric car company is not the first to hit the trillion-dollar mark. Who’s next in line and should investors start adding these names to their watchlists? First off, let’s look at the companies that have already crossed the trillion-dollar threshold. Competing neck and neck for the top spot are technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and iPhone manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Both are vying for pole position with market capitalisations of nearly US$2.5 trillion. Coming in third is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, at US$1.9 trillion. E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is not far behind, being worth US$1.7 trillion at last count. A common theme among quartet is a strong internet presence which comes with a large base of users. . A number of companies are not far behind in reaching the vaunted trillion-dollar level. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB), previously known as Facebook, has a market capitalisation of US$922 billion, putting it just a whisker away from the league. Interestingly, its recent name change is an attempt for the company to shift away from its namesake Facebook app as it starts building out its vision of the metaverse, an all-inclusive virtual reality space where people can interact within a computer-generated environment. Then there’s Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) which designs graphic processing units for gaming markets and manufactures graphic processing units (GPUs) for the data centres and automobile markets.

       "  ' ANNOUNCES NEW “SUPER-IONIC COATING\" Temecula, CA, Nov. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Warming Solutions, Inc., (OTC MARKETS: “GWSO”), a worldwide developer of technologies that help mitigate Global Warming and its effects on the planet announces that its engineering R&D team recently developed and successfully tested a new anode design for its sodium metal hybrid battery. (The anode is the negative electrode of a primary cell) The new anodes are polymer-coated over a super-ionic conductive ceramic electrolyte. This polymer coating is applied in the form of a film with a thickness of 100-120 microns and should protect the ceramic solid electrolyte from the destructive effects of acid gases from the atmosphere: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride. “We expect the polymer coating to extend the life of our rechargeable battery up to 15 years. A 650LB powerful battery will allow a two-ton car to travel about 750 miles. The car will be able to travel one million miles or more before it can\\'t hold a charge strong enough to power an electric car anymore. \", commented Artem Madatov, GWSO’s Chief Scientific Officer. He further continued, “The next stage of the project will be tests of the battery in the “charge-discharge” cycle, which will confirm the preservation of the battery parameters for several thousand cycles. At the same time, research and development will continue on the design of a full-size prototype battery for a passenger car. The goal of these developments is to increase the capacity of the sodium anodes up to 1000 Watt-Hours/kg. We will reach 1000 Watt-Hours/kg of anode weight. It is important to note that all current Lithium-Ion batteries have 240 to 250 Watt-Hours/kg. This will give GWSO 4 times more mileage on every vehicle our battery charges”.

Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.

       "  \" By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- The dollar surged to a 16-month high as the highest inflation in 30 years in the U.S. prompted bets on higher interest rates.

And the first lockdown of the winter in western Europe may be announced this week. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 11th November. 1. Dollar surges on rate hike bets after inflation data Inflation fears returned to haunt global markets after data showing the U.S. consumer price index rising at its fastest level in three decades. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield rose 10 basis points on Wednesday in response to the numbers, which showed a broad-based and faster-than-expected rise in prices and undermined a subsequent auction of 30-year debt. The dollar index, meanwhile, rose to its highest since June 2020, as markets anticipated a first rise in U.S. interest rates well ahead of the Federal Reserve’s current guidance. The bond market is closed Thursday for the Veterans Day holiday, but there will be central bank action elsewhere, with Mexico and Peru both tipped to raise interest rates. 2. Musk, Aron cash out  Elon Musk has completed around one-third of the stake sale he indicated was likely on Sunday, according to SEC filings. The filings show that Musk sold around 4.5 million shares over the course of three days, somewhat more than the shares he acquired through exercising options previously awarded as compensation.

       "  \" (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is pushing to accelerate development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter, aiming to solve a technical challenge that has bedeviled the auto industry. Most Read from Bloomberg Startup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation Hong Kong's New Museum Tries to Please Art World — and Beijing A Denser City, But at What Cost? An Oil Company Went Up in Flames, Burning Lenders and the Planet Elizabeth Holmes Faces Last-Ditch Chance to Testify at Trial For the past several years, Apple’s car team had explored two simultaneous paths: creating a model with limited self-driving capabilities focused on steering and acceleration -- similar to most current cars from Tesla Inc. -- or a version with full self-driving ability that doesn’t require human intervention. Under the effort’s new leader -- Apple Watch software executive Kevin Lynch -- engineers are now concentrating on the second option. Lynch is pushing for a car with a full self-driving system in the first version, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. It’s just the latest shift for the car effort, known as the Special Projects Group or “Project Titan,” which has endured strategy changes and executive turnover since starting around 2014. In September, the former head of the team, Doug Field, left for a job at Ford Motor Co. after three years in charge. In picking Lynch as his replacement, Apple went with an internal executive who isn’t a car veteran. In trying to master self-driving cars, Apple is chasing a holy grail within the industry. Tech and auto giants have spent years on autonomous vehicles, but the capabilities have remained elusive. Tesla, the market leader in electric vehicles, is still probably years away from offering fully autonomous cars. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo has suffered a rash of departures in its efforts to develop the technology. And Uber Technologies Inc. agreed to sell off its autonomous-driving division last year.

The world\\'s two biggest economies have yet to resolve disputes over tariffs, intellectual property rights and Chinese incursions into Taiwan\\'s air defense identification zone. And China\\'s sweeping regulatory crackdown, aimed largely at the technology sector, could pose yet another hurdle.

Tesla is building factories in the United States and Germany. \"We\\'re working internally with our suppliers to accomplish that goal, and not just at the end-assembly level but as far upstream as possible.\" Tesla currently uses LFP batteries from China\\'s CATL in some China-made Model 3 and Model Ys, and in the United States it started sales of entry-level Model 3 sedans with LFP. The company did not respond to a request for comment. LFP technology is considered to be cheaper and safer than nickel-based batteries, although they lack the same energy density as nickel-based ones to allow cars to travel farther on a single charge.

According to the lawsuit filed on Friday, Kwon and Terraform Labs are contesting the subpoenas issued by the SEC following a dialogue concerning Mirror Protocol, a decentralized finance protocol built on Terra, which allows users to trade \"synthetic\" assets that track the price movements of real assets, such as shares of Netflix or Tesla. The SEC has increasingly stepped up its pressure on crypto firms potentially offering unregistered securities. CoinDesk first reported the lawsuiit, which seeks to quash the subpoenas. But the company\\'s lawsuit not only disputes the subpoena and requested testimony from Kwon, a South Korea citizen and resident, but it also claims the SEC violated its own rules and hired an outside private process service company to deliver the subpoena at a crowded conference as a means to \"publicly intimidate and embarrass.\" \"In addition to violating its rules regarding service, the SEC\\'s conduct here violated its rules requiring it to keep formal orders of investigation confidential,\" the suit claims. The filing also documents a July 8, five-hour Webex call during which Kwon answered questions from SEC attorneys about how Terra\\'s Mirror Protocol functions. A subsequent request by the SEC for documents that the company said were either too broad in scope or did not exist \"evidenced the SEC\\'s misunderstanding of the nature of the Mirror Protocol itself.\" As Yahoo Finance previously documented, Terra is one of the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. While the SEC\\'s inquiry appears to focus in on Terra\\'s synthetic asset-focused Mirror Protocol, the project also powers a decentralized stablecoin that differs from cash-backed competitors.

The technology sector was among the biggest drags on the day as U.S. Treasury yields moved higher, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note touching its highest level since Oct. 27. Higher Treasury yields tend to weigh on high-growth areas such as tech, as they discount future earnings from the sector. Bank stocks, which benefit from climbing yields, advanced with bond yields on the rise as investors positioned for the potential effects of the Federal Reserve\\'s tapering of its massive asset purchases. \"Wall Street is completely fixated over what is happening in the bond market. We are starting to see yields are rising and that will, ultimately, signal that there\\'s a lot more nervousness that the Fed could be a little bit late to the game on delivering a rate hike and will be forced to react a lot quicker, given the inflationary pressures,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. \"You\\'re seeing mixed trade right now because, while a lot of traders are focused on whether these inflationary pressures will keep Treasuries or rates climbing, you\\'re also seeing manufacturing improve in the Empire State and a lot more optimism from abroad.\" Data on Monday showed manufacturing activity in New York surged to 30.9 in November, well above the prior 19.8 reading and 21.2 estimate. According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 0.12 points, or 0.00%, to end at 4,682.88 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 4.86 points, or 0.04%, to 15,853.85.

Deliveries serve as one of the most closely watched metrics at Tesla as a signal of electric-vehicle demand. On Wednesday, Tesla also reiterated its previous guidance to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Third-quarter deliveries were driven again by the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, which are combined under Tesla\\'s reporting structure. Together, these models comprised over 232,000 of the overall quarterly deliveries.

Revenue rose 17.5% year-over-year to $62.7 billion and EPS grew to $3.76 per share from $3.13 in the year-ago quarter. Both the top and bottom line easily beat consensus estimates of $61.4 billion and $3.58 per share. Same-store sales spiked 15.5%, which helped drive Costco’s robust performance last quarter, and comparable e-commerce sales increased 11.2% year-over-year. Additionally, the company’s app now has over 10 million downloads; COO Richard Galanti said that “it’s continually improving, with additional features coming soon.” Membership fee revenue moved 11.7% higher to $1.23 billion, and Costco ended fiscal 2021 with 61.7 million paid member households. This represents 6.2% growth compared to 2020. Costco did experience some margin pressure in its core merchandise categories in Q4—gross margin decreased by 0.32 percentage points year-over-year—but strong sales overall helped boost profit. Year-to-date, shares of COST have jumped 37.3%, which is above the S&P 500’s 24.7% increase. Earnings estimates have been rising too, and COST is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

Tesla's record quarter Tesla delivered its best quarter ever for revenue and profit but its stock struggled to build on gains that have left its valuation looking stretched, even by its own standards. The stock currently trades at 20 times sales and 451 times last year’s earnings. The company had already reported record production and delivery numbers for the three months through September. Its best-ever operating margin – achieved despite an unfavorable product mix and the well-documented sectoral problems involving shipping and component shortages – painted a picture of a company that is no longer dependent on emissions credits to turn a profit. The only off notes struck were in the absence of CEO Elon Musk from the regular analyst call, leaving CFO Zachary Kirkhorn to warn that supply chain issues and higher input costs may yet weigh on future quarters. 2.

By ensuring there are enough fast-charging plugs - and enough power - for the EVs it wants to sell, Europe\\'s biggest carmaker hopes to convince drivers worried about battery ranges that they can ditch their fossil fuel cars for good. Underlining its electric ambition, Volkswagen has drafted in power industry veteran Elke Temme, who spent nearly two decades at German energy companies RWE and Innogy, to help the carmaker get in better shape to take on Tesla. In the job since January, Temme, 53, has been tasked with bundling the carmaker\\'s various power activities such as procuring energy, enabling customers to charge their cars at home, and on the road, and selling the electricity required. Getting this done will require a bigger workforce and Temme plans to double the staff at Volkswagen\\'s European charging and energy division, known as Elli, to about 300 in 2022, having already tripled it this year, she told Reuters in an interview. \"We\\'re investing in huge growth areas that don\\'t always have to be profitable right away.

Hertz followed up on Musk’s tweet by reiterating that it is still moving ahead with the purchase order and has already started receiving deliveries of Tesla vehicles. However, Hertz failed to confirm if a contract had or had not been signed with Tesla in light of Musk's tweet. Over the weekend, Musk again left Twitterati open-mouthed with a bizarre poll asking his followers to vote whether he should sell 10% of his stock. The tweet read: “Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.” “I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes,” he added. With the majority of his followers voting in the favor of the stock sale, it remains to be seen if Musk keeps his promise. Tesla currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

       "  ' (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares fell after billionaire Elon Musk cast doubt on Hertz Global Holdings Inc.’s plan to buy 100,000 electric vehicles for its rental-car fleet and downplayed the deal’s potential.

Musk also said that because Tesla has demand for more vehicles than it can produce, the deal with Hertz “has zero effect on our economics.” Tesla dropped 3% Tuesday, while Hertz reversed an early decline to rise 2.7% after rival Avis Budget Group Inc. surged in part on prospects for fleet electrification efforts. Even with Tuesday’s decline, the automaker has gained 29% to a market value of $1.18 trillion since Hertz announced its EV initiative; tHertz has soared 42% in the same timeframe. Hertz said Tuesday that it’s already receiving cars under its $4.2 billion plan to add the Teslas through 2022, without responding directly to Musk’s tweet. The order is equivalent to about a tenth of what Tesla can produce annually. Its shares rebounded from earlier losses after rival Avis Budget Group Inc. rallied to a record in a retail trader-fueled frenzy. “As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging infrastructure across the company’s global operations,” Hertz said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “Deliveries of the Teslas already have started. We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet, which reflects market demand for Tesla vehicles.” Estero, Florida-based Hertz had previously said it will be paying full price for the vehicles. “The initial interest is exceeding our',\n",

The Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) said it discovered a wealth of information about Tesla\\'s Autopilot, along with data around speed, accelerator pedal positions, steering wheel angle and more. The findings will allow the government to \"request more targeted data\" to help determine the cause of accidents, the investigators said.\\xa0 The researchers already knew that Tesla vehicles encrypt and store accident related data, but not which data and how much. As such, they reverse-engineered the system and succeeded in \"obtaining data from the models S, Y, X and 3,\" which they described in a paper presented at an accident analysis conference. These data contain a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts and can help with a criminal investigation after a fatal traffic accident or an accident with injury.\\xa0 With knowledge of how to decrypt the storage, the NFI carried out tests with a Tesla Model S so it could compare the logs with real-world data. It found that the vehicle logs were \"very accurate,\" with deviations less than 1 km/h (about 0.6 MPH). The NSI also analyzed several accidents using the raw data it acquired. In one case, a Tesla on Autopilot collided with a car ahead that suddenly braked. Normally, if the Autopilot doesn\\'t brake in time, the driver is supposed to take over.\\xa0\\xa0 \"In this case, the investigation showed that the driver did indeed intervene and also within the expected response time,\" said researcher Aart Spek. \"The fact that it turned out to be a collision was because the following distance [chosen by Autopilot] was too tight in the busy traffic situation. That makes it interesting, because who is responsible for the following distance: the car or the driver?\"\\xa0 It used to be possible to extract Autopilot data from Tesla EVs, but it\\'s now encrypted in recent models, the investigators said.

       "  'By Sruthi Shankar and Hyunjoo Jin (Reuters) -Tesla Inc shares posted their worst daily fall in 14 months on Tuesday as investors dumped the high-flying stock ahead of a possible stake sale by company chief Elon Musk. Nearly $200 billion in market capitalization was wiped off from Tesla as Musk\\'s potential sales of his $17 billion stake triggered concerns about the stock\\'s valuation following a flurry of stock sales by some board members. The rout comes after Musk asked his Twitter followers over the weekend if he should sell 10% of his stake in the company as Washington proposes to hike taxes for the super-wealthy. Nearly 58% said they would support such a sale. Musk could time the proposed sale to coincide with a federal tax bill of nearly $11 billion that would be triggered by exercising a chunk of his Tesla stock options, worth $26.6 billion as of Monday\\'s close. After the sharp run-up in Tesla\\'s shares, \"Musk has used the now moot political debate on billionaire taxes as an opportunity to monetize billions of his wealth without reflecting a negative view on the company or its share price,\" wrote Michael O\\'Rourke, of Jones Trading, in a note late on Monday. \"It is highly unlikely that there are institutional buyers for Tesla shares at current prices.\" The shares are up nearly 50%% year-to-date after hitting a series of record highs, triggered by a large order for Tesla cars placed by rental car company Hertz. The electric-car maker\\'s shares ended down 12% at $1,023.50 on Tuesday, the biggest daily percentage drop since early September last year. They shed $138 billion in market capitalization, far more than the total market value of Ford Motor, in addition to losing nearly $60 billion on Monday. About $62 billion worth of Tesla shares changed hands on Tuesday, sharply up from $39 billion on Monday. “We do feel the stock has moved up substantially in the short term and is probably over-valued by about 20 percent so... for long term investors this isn’t a bad time to rebalance by any means,\" Tesla bull Ross Gerber',\n",

Aside from getting your Netflix fix in, there are multiple possible uses for Starlink broadband at Superchargers. At the least, it could replace or supplement the existing connections that handle basics like payments and charger status. That could help the company deploy Superchargers faster and in more remote areas at a time when the company hopes to start charging for non-Tesla EVs and triple the size of its station network.

The Elon Musk-founded company has claimed that the sum is “staggering” and called for a judge to step in and reconsider the decision. The company has said that the compensation should be reduced to $600,000 (around £445,000) – half for emotional distress damages and the rest in punitive damages. The sum Tesla has offered to pay is a tiny fraction compared to the $130m in punitive damages that the jury decided on in a court case in October, Bloomberg reported. Owen Diaz, who was a contracted elevator operator at the company, had said during the case hearing on 4 October that his former bosses at the California factory did not take action against his complaints of racism at the workplace. “[I] had supervisors telling me, ‘N*****, hurry up and push the button’, ‘N*****, push these batteries out of the elevator’. And they were also telling me, ‘N*****s aren’t shit’,” Mr Diaz said in October. His coworkers left racist caricatures around the workplace, scratched a racial slur in a bathroom stall, and told him to “go back to Africa”, he noted. The San Francisco court had ruled that Tesla would have to pay $6.9m in compensatory damages and the remaining $130m as punitive damages. This is believed to be one of the largest payouts ordered by a jury in US history for an individual plaintiff in a racial discrimination case. Tesla said in a court filing that while the jury believed the company “could and should have done more to root out alleged racism at the factory”, the award “simply cannot stand”. “It is an award without precedent in US anti-discrimination law,” the company said in a filing dated 16 November. “It dwarfs awards in similar — and even in the most egregious — cases.

When it was just Tesla with a crazy valuation, they could afford to dismiss this idea. Now, with Rivian, Lucid, etc., they can’t,\" Colas wrote in a note to investors. \"If I were banking Ford or GM right now, I would be pushing hard for them to spin off their electric vehicle operations.

Demand for those three blew past purchases of Tesla Inc., whose stock has plunged around 15% since hitting an all-time high less than two weeks ago. Rivian in particular has been a focus since its initial public offering, as the stock has doubled its $78 IPO price and the company now sports a market value of around $150 billion, which is more than Volkswagen AG. Demand for EV manufacturers and companies that make charging stations, like EVgo Inc., was clear on Fidelity’s platform, where many of the top buys in recent sessions have involved the industry. The four most bought stocks on Monday were Rivian, Tesla, Gores Guggenheim Inc. -- the SPAC which is set to merge with EV-maker Polestar -- and Lucid. Some on Wall Street expect companies like EVgo, Blink Charging Co., and QuantumScape Corp. to see increased interest as green energy stocks broadly benefit from Tesla’s slowdown ahead of the expected passage of the so-called Congressional reconciliation bill. Tesla’s prominent role in retail portfolios means the stock’s latest moves have “created a need to rebalance and EV/green names are very well positioned to capture the demand,” said Vanda’s Ben Onatibia and Giacomo Pierantoni. To be clear, it’s not as if Tesla’s struggling. It’s rallied nearly 50% this year and closed 4% higher on Tuesday. The difference is Lucid has quadrupled and Ford has doubled.

The driver was beta testing the “Full Self-Driving” software, and the Tesla SUV went into the wrong lane and was hit by another vehicle, according to a complaint filed by the driver with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “The car went into the wrong lane and I was hit by another driver in the lane next to my lane,” the driver wrote. The vehicle, a 2021 Tesla Model Y small SUV, gave the driver an alert halfway through the turn, and the driver tried to turn the wheel to avoid other traffic, according to the complaint. But the car took control and “forced itself into the incorrect lane, creating an unsafe maneuver putting everyone involved at risk,” the driver wrote. No one was injured in the crash, but the Model Y was severely damaged on the driver’s side, according to the complaint filed with the agency online Monday and posted in its public complaint database. The crash happened on Nov. 3, and the driver’s location is Brea, California, but the location of the crash was not identified. NHTSA does not release names of those who file complaints. It is likely the first complaint filed with the agency alleging that “Full Self-Driving” software caused a crash. A message was left Friday seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. A NHTSA spokeswoman said Friday night the agency is aware of the complaint and is communicating with Tesla to get more information. The spokeswoman says people should report safety concerns to the agency. The inquiry is another sign that NHTSA is becoming more aggressive in watching autonomous and partially automated driving systems under President Joe Biden.

We\\'re going to see more accidents happen. People are mentally checking out because they think the autonomy is more capable than it is. Missy Cummings She\\'s Missy Cummings, an expert in autonomous technologies and artificial intelligence at Duke University. Cummings has been named senior adviser for safety at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Word of Cummings\\' appointment produced an uproar among Tesla fans on Twitter that was so obnoxious and obscenely misogynistic that Cummings had to delete her Twitter account. (Warning: Linked tweet is not safe for work — in fact, not all that safe even for mature adults.) A petition on Change.org calling for Cummings\\' appointment to be reversed has accumulated more than 26,000 signatures. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg felt compelled to defend the Cummings appointment at a press conference. But he stood by it. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose every uttered thought is slavishly followed by his fan base, could have shut down this contemptible uproar. Instead, he fed it by referencing Cummings in a tweet, stating: \"Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.\" A couple of points about that. First, Elon Musk is absolutely incapable of being objective about anything related to Tesla. Second, Cummings is perhaps our most articulate critic of self-driving hype. She has been uncompromising in her criticism of Tesla for its approach to self-driving technology and its exaggerations of its capabilities, but her criticism extends to promoters of autonomous driving',\n",
       "  \"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla has issued a recall that automatically sent a software update fixing a safety problem in its electric vehicles, apparently heading off a looming confrontation with U.S. safety regulators. But recall documents posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website Tuesday don't address another safety issue specified by the agency when it demanded that Tesla explain why it wasn't doing recalls for safety-related software updates done over the internet. The recall covers nearly 12,000 Teslas with a glitch in the “Full Self-Driving” software that can make the cars stop for no good reason. The company's paperwork says the problems with automatic emergency braking can increase the risk of other vehicles hitting Teslas from behind. The recall covers all four Tesla models — the S, X, 3 and Y. Tesla documents say a software update sent on Oct. 23 introduced the glitch. Company documents say Tesla started getting reports from owners the next day about phantom braking. In a matter of hours, the company says it canceled further updates or reverted the software to a previous version. That disabled emergency braking on some of the vehicles. On Oct. 24, the company traced the cause to a communication disconnect between two computer chips. It developed another software update to fix the problem and sent it out on Oct. 25, according to the documents. The company said it voluntarily agreed to do a recall on Oct. 26. The move appears to show that Tesla now will issue a recall when it pushes out software updates to fix safety issues. It also sets a precedent for other automakers that they do the same. On Oct. 12, regulators sent a letter to Tesla demanding to know why the company didn't recall its vehicles when it sent a software update to fix a problem with its Autopilot partially automated driving system. The update addressed detection of emergency vehicles parked on roads while crews responded to crashes. The NHTSA opened an investigation of Autopilot in August after getting reports of a dozen crashes into emergency vehicles. The investigation covers 765,000 vehicles, almost everything\",\n",
       "  ' Tel Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- Nofar Energy Ltd. Nofar Energy expands further its collaboration with Tesla: the company reported today it had entered a second framework agreement with Tesla on purchasing battery stored power systems with a total capacity of 200 megawatts for $54 million. Under the agreement, Nofar will pay 5% of the consideration on the contract signing date and the balance according to predefined milestones. The storage systems will be supplied from January 2023 through March 2024. This second agreement entered by Nofar and Tesla brings the total capacity of the storage systems to be built as part of the collaboration to 300 MW/h. Most of the storage systems covered by the first agreement entered in February 2021 for 100 MW/h are under or nearing construction. Given the fast implementation pace of the first agreement and the considerable demand, Nofar Energy decided to expand the collaboration with an additional contract for a larger capacity. Nofar estimates its EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) revenues from the second agreement will total ~ NIS 250 million. The annual revenues from power sales (arbitrage and grid services) are expected to total NIS 20-50 million. Moreover, the construction of the storage systems will enable building additional solar systems at high rates in areas characterized by overloaded grids, which could not be achieved in the absence of the storage systems. Nofar Energy plans to develop and manage the storage systems for existing and new partnerships the company and its partners own, including kibbutzim, real estate, commercial, and industrial companies. Several weeks ago, Nofar completed the construction and connection of Tesla’s first storage facility in Israel, in Kibbutz Shoval. Next week, the facility will be inaugurated at a ceremony attended by Tesla executives and representatives of Israel’s energy ministry and Electric Authority. Offering a capacity of 2.718 MW/h, the new facility allows overcoming the constraints placed by the local power grid through connecting additional photo-voltaic systems with significant capacity at a high rate of NIS 0.45 per each Kw/h produced. Moreover, the storage system offers additional economic value due to the planned raising of',\n",

       "  ' Miller Value Partners, an investment management firm, published its “Miller Opportunity Equity” third quarter 2021 investor letter – a copy of which can be seen here. A quarterly net decline of 14.2% has been recorded by the fund for the third quarter of 2021, compared to the S&P 500 that rose 0.6% in the same period. You can take a look at the fund’s top 5 holdings to have an idea about their best picks for 2021. Miller Value Partners, in its Q3 2021 investor letter, mentioned General Motors (NYSE: GM) and discussed its stance on the firm. General Motors is a Detroit, Michigan-based multinational automotive manufacturing company with an $85.1 billion market capitalization. GM delivered a 40.83% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 40.83%. The stock closed at $58.64 per share on November 4, 2021. Here is what Miller Value Partners has to say about General Motors in its Q3 2021 investor letter: \"Another name we’ve recently purchased and have grown incredibly excited about: General Motors (GM). GM is interesting on many levels. We see it as an attractive investment opportunity and it might be a microcosm of current markets, both past and prospective. Tesla trounced GM over the last decade. Tesla rose 15,797% crushing GM’s 238% increase, which lagged the S&P 500’s 365%. Tesla came out of nowhere creating what many said was the best car ever made. A decade ago, no one saw that coming, including GM. GM’s historical strength led to arrogance. It completely dismissed the threat of any newcomer. Where are we now? Expectations are entirely different. Tesla’s current price embeds 18 years of growth while GM embeds under one year (see a pattern in what we like?!). Tesla’s expectations look even loftier when you consider that in that 18th year, Tesla would be projected to earn $1.35 trillion revenues at very high, Ferrari-type margins. The largest automakers today generate roughly $250 billion revenues at less than half those margins. Tesla’s priced to go where no man (or woman!) has gone before. It’s impossible for Tesla',\n",
       "  'Introduced for 2021, the Volkswagen ID.4 is the German automaker’s first all-electric SUV and part of a new wave of electric vehicles for American consumers. It boasts a spacious interior and styling that’s futuristic but not too futuristic. The ID.4 is the upstart against two established rivals: the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. The Model Y is an SUV but it’s considerably more expensive than the ID.4. As such, the popular Model 3 sedan, which is versatile in its own right, is an excellent yardstick to measure against. Edmunds’ experts compared the ID.4 and Model 3 to find out which one is the better buy. RANGE AND CHARGING On a full charge, the 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 delivers an EPA-estimated range of 240-260 miles depending on trim level. The base Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus boasts an EPA-estimated 263 miles of range, while the aptly named Long Range model claims 353 miles of range. This might seem like an easy win for Tesla, but there’s more to it than that. The ID.4 outperformed its EPA estimates in Edmunds’ real-world range testing, with an ID.4 Pro going 28 miles farther than its estimated 260 miles on a full charge. Meanwhile, all of the Tesla Model 3s Edmunds has tested over the years have come up slightly short in real-world driving range compared to the EPA estimates. The upshot: Yes, the Model 3 can go farther on a full charge than the ID.4, but the difference in everyday driving isn’t as big as the EPA estimates suggest. Both EVs are easy to charge at home and can be quickly recharged at DC fast-charging stations. The Model 3 does have an advantage because of Tesla’s proprietary Supercharger network. These chargers have more convenient locations and are less of a hassle to use than other third-party charging networks. Winner: Model 3 PRICING AND VALUE Standard features are similar for the ID.4 and Model 3, but the ID.4 has the edge on pricing. The ID.4 starts at $41,190 for a rear-wheel-drive Pro model, which comes with a 10-inch central display, Android Auto and Apple',\n",

TSLA tanks on the news and Musk loses $50 billion. Then Musk sells 5.2 million shares or $5.8 billion of stock (as of Friday.) Tesla shares rally. Musk is still the richest man in the world. Item 2: On Tuesday, electric truck maker Rivian goes public. Its stock soars 29% in the biggest IPO since the company formerly known as Facebook debuted in 2012. Rivian’s (RIVN) market value of $100 billion is bigger than Ford’s or GM’s. Item 3: Also on Tuesday, Hertz, which had its IPO this week, confirms it is going to buy 100,000 Teslas, highlighted in an ad campaign, “Let’s Go!” featuring Tom Brady. So the week might sound kind of bananas but in this quarter of the business universe, that’s actually pretty much SOP. It’s also the case that EVs, Elon and all things electric aren’t fringe anymore.

It’s been an exceptionally strong year. 70% are coming from China and Europe. In China and Europe they’re firmly in the mainstream now. In the U.S., EV sales have been lagging compared to China and Europe around 6% or so,” he said. That will change. And there’s everything',\n",

SONO. Investors looking for solid returns will benefit from adding stocks with favorable liquidity in their investment portfolio. Liquidity measures a company’s ability to meet short-term debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been on investors’ radar owing to their potential for solid returns. However, one should be cautious enough before investing in such stocks. A high liquidity level may indicate that the company is clearing its dues faster than its peers. However, it may also suggest that the company is not able to utilize its assets effectively. Hence, one may consider a company’s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity for identifying prospective winners. Current Ratio:\\xa0It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the company failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal. Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio — also called “acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" — reflects on a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable. Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account cash and cash equivalents as well as invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point toward sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization. A ratio greater',\n",

The program will be tested at 10 locations in the Netherlands, the company said on Monday, adding that Dutch non-Tesla EV drivers can access the Tesla stations, or Superchargers, through the Tesla app. (Graphic: Tesla opens superchargers for other EVs: https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-EVCHARGING/zdvxormmrpx/chart.png) Tesla drivers can continue to use these stations and the company will closely monitor each site for congestion.

The Superchargers are open to cars with the Combined Charging System (CCS) favored by BMW, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen, which includes Audi and Porsche. Tesla uses the CCS standard in Europe, allowing a wide range of cars to charge in stations without an adapter that uses a similar connector. Charging prices for non-Tesla drivers will include extra costs to support a broad range of vehicles and site adjustments to accommodate these vehicles, Tesla said.

Big Market Splashes: Tesla the Tech Giant, Huge IPOs & SPACs If there is one thing you have heard about electric vehicles this year, it has probably been about Tesla reaching tech-giant status. In November 2021, Tesla surpassed a $1000,000,000,000 market cap, driven by a slightly confused order from Hertz for 100,000 full price Tesla electric cars (contracts were apparently unsigned while deliveries began). More generally, Tesla's stock is high because investors are betting on the company's potential. Despite its huge achievements, Tesla is still only at the beginning of its S-curve. Today, Tesla is hitting sales targets (approaching 1 million car sales in 2021) and demonstrating it can turn a consistent profit. Tomorrow its new giga-factories will help it reach its goal to sell 20 million cars annually by 2030 (more than a fifth of global car sales today). Assuming an average of $30k per Tesla car, reaching even a quarter of this equals revenues of $150 billion – a third of the $450 billion plug-in electric car market predicted by IDTechEx in 2030 (www.IDTechEx.com/EV). This is without considering its growing energy business or the potential of future technologies, such as autonomy. While Tesla is also working on electric trucks, IDTechEx expects passenger cars to remain the most profitable electric vehicle market now and in the future, and the main driver for Tesla's growth. Tesla's successes are paving the way for others. Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, became public early in November 2021 to the tune of $93 billion. Hundred-year-old Ford's stock has been rallying itself this year, but its market cap still sits below Rivian's at $77.7 billion. Rivian's traditional IPO rode against the SPAC trend opted for by numerous others (SPACS can be viewed as easier with less valuation risk than a traditional IPO).

Tesla Rallies Ahead of Results to Beat S&P 500’s Gains: Chart Telsa’s handling of the chip shortage even drew praise from one of its biggest competitors. “One example for the speed of Tesla: They handle the chip shortage very well – the reason: they are developing their own software,” said Herbert Diess, chairman of Volkswagen AG in a LinkedIn post. “Within just 2-3 weeks they had a new software which allows to use different chips.

Renaissance added slightly more than 610,000 shares in the company, nearly quadrupling its stake, while Adage added a new position of 42,800 shares and Aristides added a new position of 8,500 shares, according to SEC disclosures. Overall, 211 hedge funds and asset management firms added new positions in Tesla last quarter, while 116 firms closed out of their positions in the company, according data-tracking firm WhaleWisdom. Tesla shares surged 43.5% in October, fueled in part by the announcement of an order from car-rental company Hertz. They pared some of those gains in November, with the company\\'s value dipping below $1 trillion on Monday as investors reacted to CEO Elon Musk\\'s recent share sales of a combined $6.9 billion.

The stock has fallen 18.5% from its Nov. 4 record high of $1,243.49, shortly before Musk announced that he was selling 10% of his stake in the company after floating the idea in a Twitter poll.

       "  \" (Bloomberg) -- There were plenty of reasons for Tesla Inc. to rally Monday.

Hamburg Is at the Heart of Germany’s Growing Dilemma Over China Why Americans and Britons Are Rushing to Buy Idyllic Homes in Italy One of California’s Wealthiest Counties Could Run Out of Water Next Summer The Top Money Maker at Deutsche Bank Reaps Billions From Singapore But other forces were at play in goosing the gain: options traders who piled on bullish bets, and market makers who were forced to purchase shares to hedge their positions as the stock surged. In other words, the tail wagging the dog. It’s a narrative that’s come up repeatedly in explaining mysterious moves, such as the big-tech rally in the summer of 2020 and this year’s mid-month market swoons. More than 2.4 million bullish contracts on Tesla changed hands Monday, a 14-month high, as traders rushed into speculative wagers to reap quick gains. The most-active contract, the $1,000 call expiring Friday, soared to $39.34 from $1.60 -- for a single-session gain of about 2,360%. Investors spent $5.11 billion on call options, compared with a total of $279 million on puts, according to an estimate by Nomura Securities. The firm calls the 18-to-1 ratio “unheard of.” And all the spike in calls means options dealers needed to snap up shares to avoid unwanted risk. “This is incredible activity,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Financial Pty, wrote in a client note. “We’ve seen a clear lack of regard for the cost of the options,” he added. “The stock subsequently goes in the money and dealers (who sold the calls) have to hedge their delta –- that means buying the underlying –- again this perpetuates the stock higher.” Shares of Tesla surged 13% Monday, lifting its market value above $1 trillion for the first time and propelling the automaker past Facebook Inc. to become the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the U.S.\",\n",
       "  \" The stock market has bounced back after a sluggish September, but a billionaire hedge fund manager says it would be a mistake to drop your guard. Paul Tudor Jones, who runs Tudor Investment Corporation, told CNBC last week that runaway inflation remains “the single biggest threat to financial markets and society in general.” “If we don't immediately shift to attack it,” Jones warns, “we run the risk of getting back into the '70s, where it was the single most important issue for multiple presidents, multiple Fed chairmen.” Regardless of what the officials in Washington do, you can take action to protect your own portfolio. Here are three assets you can use to hedge against inflation, even if you just sprinkle some of your spare change on them. Due to their violent swings in value, cryptocurrencies remain a higher-risk solution to the problem of inflation. But more and more investors — including Jones — are getting onboard. “We're moving into an increasingly digitized world. Clearly there's a place for crypto, and it's winning the race against gold,” he says. “Crypto would be my preferred inflation hedge over gold at the moment.” There are many ways to play the crypto boom. For instance, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF holds bitcoin futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Investors can also get exposure to Bitcoin through companies that have tied themselves to the crypto market, such as Coinbase, Tesla and PayPal. Of course, you can also purchase Bitcoin directly. Crypto exchanges often charge up to 4% in commission fees, but some investing apps charge 0%. Real estate has been a popular inflation hedge throughout history. Not only do real estate prices tend to increase in an inflationary environment, but rental properties can also generate a stable income stream for investors. These days, however, you don’t need to be a landlord to collect rent checks. Publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) own and operate income-producing properties on investors’ behalf. Jones happens to own quite a few shares in this sector. According to Tudor’s latest 13F filing with the Securities Exchange Commission,\",\n",
       "  ' By Anders Melin and Dana Hull (Bloomberg) — From a penthouse overlooking the pale blue Singapore Strait, a discreet billionaire made a startling claim: he’d quietly amassed one of the single biggest stakes in Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. “I believe in Elon’s great mission,” Leo KoGuan told the world via Twitter. And with that one tweet in September, KoGuan — already a billionaire in his own right — began to dribble out details to believers and skeptics alike. More, the value of his supposed holdings soared and soared: to US$4 billion, US$5 billion — and, now, to more than US$7 billion. Is it true? Could a single obscure investor, even one as wealthy as KoGuan, amass such a huge position in a company like Tesla with scarcely anyone noticing? Could he really have become Tesla’s third-largest individual shareholder, behind fellow billionaire Larry Ellison and none other than Elon Musk, the richest person in history? Yes. Bank records provided to Bloomberg News by KoGuan and confirmed by people familiar with his investments show he owned 6.31 million Tesla shares as of late September. He also held 1.82 million options giving him the right to buy Tesla between US$450 to US$550 a share — contracts that are deeply in the money after the stock closed at US$1,114 on Friday in New York. Speaking via Zoom from his living room 63 floors above Singapore’s harbour, KoGuan, 66, provided a glimpse into his astonishing investment. The view from his aerie — a world away from the New Jersey technology business he co-owns — stretches from Batam Island to the south to Malaysia to the north to Indonesia to the west. Wearing a white T-shirt, KoGuan laid out a no-frills roadmap to his trading riches: stick to a single stock, in this case, Tesla; keep doubling down; and, most important, believe in Elon Musk. “Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,” KoGuan says. “Fortunately, I win more of the time than I lose.” Stranger claims have been made — and proved to be true — in an age when unfathomable fortunes sometimes seem to appear',\n",

Tesla, in the meantime, has surpassed the combined market capitalization of the next nine biggest automakers. To put things into perspective, major peers such as Toyota, GM, and Ford are just worth $237 billion, $84 billion, and $64 billion, respectively. In reality, the price leap in Tesla’s shares was triggered by news that Hertz would buy 100,000 of the automaker’s Model 3 fleet. Such a purchase will certainly help Tesla become a brand for the masses and not just the affluent. Presently, the Model 3 sells for about $40,000.

General Motors Company AB Volvo Ford Motor Company Nissan Motor Co., Ltd Growth in the Electric Vehicles Market is mainly driven by growing environmental concerns and the active steps taken by various governments towards zero emission laws, thereby reducing the carbon emissions in the environment. Increasing two and three wheeler demand is expected to boost the demand of Electric Vehicles (EVs) but the demand is offset by the slow adaptation in leading countries like Japan. Additionally, the growing efforts by companies to boost production, expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure along with charging points are projected to further drive the market growth. Moreover, rising expenditure by the government, carbon emission regulation policies and investments by leading OEMs is boosting the need for Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the industry, which is, in turn, driving the market demand. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has affected the global economy of various sectors, including the oil & gas, manufacturing, automotive, and power generation industries in multiple ways. With the new government guidelines during the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a temporary suspension of the production units during the initial days of the lockdown. This led to disruptions in the production facilities and global supply chains as the electric vehicles manufacturers had to make certain adjustments with the volume of production because of the excess inventory which was left idle.

       " 'BTC': [\"Supply chain woes continue to paint an increasingly bleak the picture for the trucking industry, said Jason Seidl, Cowen managing director of industrials — airfreight and surface transportation. Finding workers to drive trucks has increasingly been an issue in the industry, according to Seidl. “Clearly, we've had some problems hiring truckers lately,” he said in a segment with Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. “I've been around the trucking industry almost 30 years, and I've never quite seen it this bad.” A labor shortage beginning early 2021 has stretched across multiple industries across the nation, but the trucking industry in particular has sustained some nasty blows to its labor force. According to the American Truckers Association, the US currently faces an all-time high shortage of 80,000 truckers. An infrastructure bill signed into law by President Biden attempts to alleviate some of these concerns for the trucking industry and transportation services in general. The $1.2 trillion law includes provisions for roads and bridges amounting to $110 billion as well as $17 billion for ports. “Our baseline view right now is things get a little bit better in December, then we get tight again in January,” Seidl said. “We start probably clearing up around 2Q and into the back half of the year. Look, we have an infrastructure bill that is signed into law … That's going to help. But that's not going to really get us any near-term help.” Disruption issues are embedded deeply within the supply chain, Seidl added. “It goes beyond just a handful of large retailers, right?” he said. “So it goes to the port truckers, it goes to the warehousing operations, it goes to the railroads. This is an entire supply chain. And so, these are all links of the chain.” Seasonal variances may help right the metaphorical ship for ports-based infrastructure, Seidl said, as reduced traffic in the winter months may ease supply-demand imbalances. “If you look at right now, yeah, things are bad now, but the calendar is going to be our friend with seasonality,” he noted. “Typically, post-Thanksgiving the ports get a lot slower.

In a Friday order, the regulator reiterated its long-stated concern that basing a product on the spot price of Bitcoin could violate securities rules because the market is too prone to abuse. “The Commission has consistently required that the listing exchange have a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to Bitcoin, or demonstrate that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices are sufficient,” the SEC said. “The listing exchange has not met that requirement.” Bitcoin extended losses after the rejection, but recouped some of them in mid-afternoon trading. It was down 1.5% to $64,086 as of 3:46 p.m. in New York. The largest cryptocurrency had rallied to an all-time high of $68,991 this week. “We are obviously disappointed in today’s update from the SEC declining approval of our physical Bitcoin ETF,” said Jan van Eck, chief executive of his namesake firm. “We continue to believe that investors should have the ability to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated investment product and that a non-futures ETF structure is the superior approach.” SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said he’s comfortable with futures-based ETFs because Bitcoin futures trade on highly regulated exchanges.

It\\'s the most honest market we have in the country, and it\\'s telling us that this decrepit … regime is just about to blow up.\" The venture capitalist made his comments before bitcoin blasted higher Wednesday to a record high of $66,812.68 on the back of Tuesday\\'s trading debut of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first bitcoin-futures exchange-traded fund. The price of the most traded digital coin overtook the previous high of $64,804.72, which was logged in April, around the time when the crypto exchange Coinbase went public. Thiel has made crypto-industry investments through venture-capital firms he\\'s helped establish, including the Founders Fund. He is a backer of 1confirmation, along with Marc Andreessen and Mark Cuban. Speaking at Monday\\'s conference hosted by the Stanford Law School chapter of the Federalist Society, Thiel suggested eliminating environmental and immigration laws to balance the US government\\'s budget, The Information said, adding that Thiel called President Joe Biden a \"catastrophe.\" He also spoke against \"the Clinton-Obama retreads rearranging the deck chairs and mopping the floors\" of the Titanic, and against the world\\'s central banks, saying the US Federal Reserve is a \"center-left institution that\\'s the most overvalued in the entire Western world.\" Now is the time where the \"one-world state\" stops, and with the help of crypto, \"we\\'re going to succeed,\" he said, according to The Information.

       "  'Investors expect the Fed to formally announce the start to tapering of its asset purchase program  Written by Aditya Raghunath at The Motley Fool Canada The world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin touched a record-high of more than US$67,000 last month. At the time of writing, a single Bitcoin is priced at US$60,750, valuing the cryptocurrency at a market cap of US$1.14 trillion. A key driver of Bitcoin’s exponential gains in the last 18 months can be attributed to the widespread adoption of the digital asset by institutions. In fact, several publicly listed companies, including Tesla and MicroStrategy, now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. The CEOs of both these companies — Elon Musk and Michael Saylor — have been quite vocal about the long-term potential of Bitcoin. At the end of Q3, MicroStrategy held more than $7 billion worth of Bitcoin on its books, which is quite significant, given the company is valued at a market cap of $7.62 billion. MicroStrategy has raised debt capital to purchase Bitcoin, which might be viewed as a high-risk strategy given the volatility associated with the digital asset. However, if the price of Bitcoin continues to touch record highs in the future, MicroStrategy’s gamble will be rewarded by a massive uptick in its share prices. Several other C-level executives on Wall Street remain skeptical about the cryptocurrency space. Last month, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon explained that cryptocurrencies will soon be regulated by governments for anti-money-laundering and tax purposes. Dimon said, “I personally think that Bitcoin is worthless.” But one of the largest banks also provides access to cryptocurrencies for its wealth management clients, which suggests JPMorgan derives a small portion of its revenue from this highly disruptive asset class. Dimon is not the only Bitcoin bear on Wall Street. In a CNBC interview last year, investment mogul Warren Buffett stated, “I don’t have any Bitcoin. I don’t own any cryptocurrency, I never will.” The Oracle of Omaha further warned, “Cryptocurrencies basically have no value. They don’t produce anything. You can’t do anything with it except sell it to somebody else. But then that',\n",

Subscribe Tuesday, November 2, 2021 There’s a lot happening in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency nowadays, and two trends highlighted over the last few days underscore why regulators are trying to get ahead of developments in the sector — even if some think they’re already behind the curve. While bitcoin sucks up the most oxygen in the crypto world, there are other digital coins that investors and policymakers are just starting to wrap their heads around. Last week, with market players transfixed by the rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB), another memecoin based on the hugely popular “Squid Game” Netflix series came from nowhere. In a matter of days, the squid coin went supernova — then crashed and burned as developers yanked the rug out from aspiring crypto fortune-hunters. To crib a phrase from that chef from Seinfeld, “no soup for you.” SHIB’s sudden rise and the commensurate drop in squid couldn't have arrived at a more auspicious time. On Monday, the U.S. government released a long-awaited set of recommendations on how regulators and lawmakers should treat stablecoin, a slice of the digital coin market where values are tied to fiat currencies like U.S. dollars or shorter-dated securities. Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schonberger, who’s been pursuing this story for weeks, noted that the inter-agency recommendations “are intended to curtail risks posed to the financial system,” and that regulators are calling on Congress to mandate that issuers “become banks subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency.” As one might expect, crypto players like the Chamber of Digital Commerce (which also spoke to Schonberger last week) are pushing back against the idea that an asset whose very existence is predicated upon being stable could pose systemic risk. Other market participants like Circle co-founder, CEO and Chairman Jeremy Allaire see the writing on the wall, and want to at least make sure they get to choose the ink. “We are fully supportive of\",\n",
       "  'Bitcoin’s price crashed on Wednesday morning, falling below $60,000 (£43,725), just a week after hitting a new all-time high. At the time of writing, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was down roughly 6% to trade at $59,115. Last week, it had soared to an all-time high of around $67,000, a day after the first-ever bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (^AMZI). Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world\\'s second largest crypto by market cap, was down 4% and was trading at $4,004. \"The prices of bitcoin have shed approximately 8% in the last 24 hours as the crypto-asset struggles to hold firm above the psychological level of $60,000,\" Kunal Sawhney, the CEO of equities research firm Kalkine Group, told Yahoo Finance UK. He believes a 5% to 10% correction is \"quite normal\" when prices have already escalated more than 55% in a month. \"This seems like a window for profit-booking as bitcoin prices advanced exceptionally in the present month, hitting a fresh all-time high of $67,000 from sub-$42,000 levels,\" he said. But alongside profit-booking, he believes investors’ optimism has taken a hit after a choppy Wall Street session earlier in the week, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC)\\xa0closing flat.

He added that increased activity on launching the digital euro by the European Central Bank (ECB) has also impacted confidence, and he feels regulatory hurdles will continue to hurt cryptocurrencies unless a major central bank or a capital market watchdog take the direct control of dealing and transactions.

       "  ' Watch: Philip Hammond on why crypto adoption is unstoppable  Former UK chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond claims institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency characteristics of tokenisation and distributed ledger technology is now “unstoppable”. In an interview with Yahoo Finance UK, the Conservative life-peer said that “trading characteristics that are currently associated with crypto assets will become normal patterns of business with conventional assets as they are tokenised.\\xa0 \"This is going to happen, we have probably got to a point where this is unstoppable,” said Lord Hammond. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is the blockchain-based bedrock that allows cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) to bypass centralised financial authorities when conducting peer to peer transactions. According to Hammond the progressive technologies that are the hallmarks of the cryptocurrency ecosystem will \"bring many benefits and introduce significant efficiencies”. He listed the advantages of distributed ledger technology, such as “increased security, transparency, speed of settlement and lower execution costs for customers\". However, he warned that the consequences of onboarding these new mechanisms will be hugely disruptive to the existing financial services infrastructure. \"The bulk of the disruption would be sustained by incumbents of institutional markets and that these market participants will be concerned about the disruptive effect on jobs in the sector.\" The former chief financial minister emphasised the benefits of DLT and blockchain technology as \"representing a huge opportunity for London and the UK’s financial services sector as a whole”.\\xa0 He said: \"Britain must seize this opportunity to remain a global financial services hub.” And described how the City of London has traditionally been able to exploit disruptive technologies and adapt faster than their competitors, but suggested a current malaise exists where City firms are preoccupied with “thinking about what the future looks like” because of post-Brexit complications. He urged the current Conservative cabinet to create the conditions for London to lead in this burgeoning space so that “regulators sit up and take note and respond appropriately.” Read more: Ethereum falls from all-time high but Solana on track to hit $250 Hammond is now a senior adviser with Copper, a London-based provider',\n",

The ethereum token has the potential to \"power the rails of all global finance\" through DeFi use, he told Insider. Ether has climbed to new highs recently, and there is around $100 billion in total value locked on the network. Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell. Crypto hedge fund manager Rahul Rai believes the market will see ether overtake bitcoin in terms of market capitalization before the middle of next year, in what experts call \"the flippening\". The native token of the ethereum network hit record highs above $4,600 this week, after CME Group, the world\\'s largest derivatives exchange, said it would launch micro ether futures in early December. Ether\\'s rise was propelled by a series of developments that underscored the growing momentum in the digital market beyond pure cryptocurrencies. Facebook recently said it would rebrand itself as Meta, in a nod to its commitment to expanding its activities in the metaverse, while metaverse gaming platform Sandbox raised $3 million in a day. Even K-pop sensations BTS are set to launch digital photocards in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thanks to a collaboration unveiled this week between their agency and South Korea\\'s biggest cryptocurrency operator. The ethereum network now has around $100 billion total value locked onto it, according to The Block data. Yet ethereum is still very much second to bitcoin in terms of market value. This might not be the case for very much longer, according to Rai, the co-head of market neutral at BlockTower Capital. \"I definitely think there\\'s a really good chance for ether to surpass bitcoin. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if it happened within the cycle,\" the 24-year-old told Insider. \"Very tough to predict when this cycle will end. My take is mid-next year,\" he continued.

Prior to this role, she was the CEO of Heineken Ireland. As CEO of Heineken USA, Timoney oversees US operations of the company, which is headquartered in Amsterdam, and is involved in distributing a range of brands in addition to Heineken itself, including Dos Equis, Tecate, Red Stripe, and Amstel Light. The largely niche world of high alcohol content beers includes a range of - often quite expensive - options when it comes to aged “highly spirited” brews. A British beer called Brewmeister Snake Venom advertises itself as the strongest beer in the world with a whopping 67% alcohol by volume (ABV), selling for about $50 a bottle. Timoney was specifically asked about “Utopias,” a line of high-alcohol beers from the Sam Adams company. That brew is so loaded with alcohol – 28% ABV compared to 5% in a standard Sam Adams – that it is illegal in 15 states. The beer is aged in bourbon casks, is “extremely limited,” according to the company, and carries a suggested retail price of $240.

U.S. retail sales rose 1.7% in October, topping consensus expectations of a 1.4% rise, likely as Americans started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves amid shortages of some goods as the ongoing pandemic squeezes supply chains. At 3:15 p.m. EST, the dollar index was up 0.385% at 95.898, having earlier touched 95.928, its highest since July 2020. The dollar has rallied since U.S. inflation data last week showed consumer prices surged to their highest rate since 1990, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected. \"If you look at U.S. markets, there\\'s a lot more speculation, at least within implied market pricing, that they will be hiking on more than one occasion next year,\" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities. \"After last week’s U.S. CPI report, the dam just broke and the dollar and the FX complex is certainly tagging along for the ride.\" \"Today’s retail sales report only adds fuel to the fire,\" he said.

And according to Blockchain.com founder Peter Smith, 2022 will see more competition emerge in the industry. “It's very hard to have lost money in crypto over the last year,” Smith said. “Some people have managed to do it, but it's quite hard. And so we're going to get into a harder, more competitive environment, I think, over the next year. And that's actually going to be net good for the market because it's going to start separating the good from the bad.” In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Zack Guzman as part of the Yahoo Finance/Decrypt: Crypto Goes Mainstream summit, Smith discussed his outlook for the crypto industry going into the next year. The summit featured conversations with some of the biggest names in crypto to talk investing, mass adoption, NFT collecting, and how to get started. As for what competition in 2022 may look like, Smith believes that the market will likely begin to gravitate towards crypto platforms that are seeing the highest growth from a usage perspective rather than solely from an investment standpoint. This dynamic would distinguish the “momentum machines” from crypto platforms with “real technical value,” he said. Smith cited how institutions are already beginning to look beyond Ethereum and bitcoin. “So we're seeing volume and flow that's outside Ethereum and bitcoin in our institutional business today, which is really kind of interesting,” Smith said. “And [it] happened a lot faster than we thought it would. That is going to impact prices.” Indeed, other players with major DeFi applications are steadily entering the scene.

       "  'Bitcoin and AUD/JPY price charts (TradingView) The “bitcoin is an inflation hedge” drumbeat is growing louder as the cryptocurrency tapped fresh record highs near $69,000 last Wednesday, after the U.S. reported inflation at a three-decade high. That was perhaps the first time the decade-old cryptocurrency traded as a store of value asset in response to economic data bolstering fears of price pressures moving out of control. However, traditional finance experts are still not convinced about its growing acceptance as digital gold, a safe haven. “The crypto rally on high inflation is a hint on where it’s headed as an asset class, but the sharp, late-day drop underscores the limitations,” said Adam Button, currency analyst and managing editor at ForexLive. “For now, bitcoin is still a risk-on asset.” Risk-on refers to a situation where investors are willing to invest in growth-sensitive assets like industrial metals, equity markets, commodity currencies. That typically happens when the economy is expected to fare well, or fiat currency liquidity is abundant. Bitcoin is quite sensitive to expectations of changes in fiat liquidity. The cryptocurrency charted a sixfold rally to over $60,000 in 10 months to April 2021 as the U.S. Federal Reserve printed trillions of dollars to counter the coronavirus-induced recession. And while bitcoin rose by $3,000 on inflation data, the gains were more than reversed by day’s end as the interest rate markets priced in greater probability of faster and sooner Fed rate hikes. Equity markets witnessed a similar action. Central banks often raise borrowing costs and suck out liquidity from the system to contain inflation. “Bitcoin’s reaction to inflation was seemingly more aligned to the stock market’s reading into the implications for a perhaps stretched speculative exposure rather than the dollar’s value erosion,” said John Kicklighter, chief strategist at forex research portal DailyFX. “The cryptocurrency’s use seems to be less as a utility (like an anti-fiat) rather than a speculative vehicle to diversify into.” The comments suggest that the cryptocurrency needs to develop resilience to stock market sell-off to cement its position as a risk-off asset and attract more safe haven demand from traditional',\n",

       "  \" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile and have been viewed as risky by skeptics within Wall Street ranks and veteran investors. And yet, more are warming up to the notion of crypto as part of a diversified portfolio, given what’s being viewed as its technological staying power. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar, says cryptocurrencies can be a part of a diversified portfolio. “Crypto is definitely becoming more established as a separate asset class and moving more into the investment mainstream,” she told Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit this week, as part of a crypto panel discussion. “It's definitely something that long-term investors should consider if they're more risk tolerant.” However, Arnott recommended keeping crypto to a smaller allocation of an overall portfolio, noting that 1%-2% can go a long way. “I would definitely handle it with care, because the volatility has been so high. Even a very small percentage of cryptocurrency can really spike up your portfolio's risk profile,” Arnott added. The global cryptocurrency market is now worth over $2.6 trillion and growing. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, but in some instances has demonstrated a lower correlation with mainstream asset classes like stocks and bonds, and sold off less with other risk assets when markets drop. ... if you're looking to add crypto exposure to your portfolio, you're probably better off buying it directly through a crypto exchange or platform.Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Isaiah Jackson, the best-selling author of “Bitcoin & Black America,” says bitcoin is a long-term asset and will remain that way. “If you want to be a part of it, you have to think long-term,” he told Yahoo Finance this week. “In any new market you will have volatility. You're not going to get rich just because you entered the market. You do have to have patience. But if you invest long-term the volatility does not matter,” he added. Arnott said investing in crypto can be thought of as investing in the Internet in the late 1990s. “I think you have a lot of the same kind of growth trajectories,” she said.\",\n",

According to research reports, 46 million Americans, which is 22% of the adult population, have exposure to Bitcoin, while the number of blockchain wallet users has touched 77.43 million in October 2021, up from just one million at the start of 2014. An investment of $1,000 in Bitcoin five years back, would be worth close to $90,000 today, and these gains would be exponentially higher if we extend our timeline. At the time of writing, the price of one Bitcoin is trading at US$61,400, valuing the most popular cryptocurrency at a market cap of US$1.15 trillion. According to Bitcoin bulls, the digital asset might even be valued at a market cap of US$100 trillion in the future, accounting for a significant portion of total global assets. If you are bullish in the cryptocurrency space and want to invest in this highly disruptive asset class, you can do so in multiple ways. Canadians can buy and hold Bitcoins on a cryptocurrency exchange such as Wealthsimple Crypto or Coinsmart. There are multiple cryptocurrency exchanges that have been launched over the years, and the investor can compare relevant platform fees or commissions to make an informed decision. Canada has also launched several Bitcoin ETFs or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent months, such as Purpose Bitcoin ETF, Evolve Bitcoin ETF, and CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF. These ETFs will replicate Bitcoin gains, and the difference in total returns will be limited to the management fee collected by these ETFs. The ETFs can be held in registered accounts such as the TFSA or RRSP, which suggests investors can benefit from tax-free gains as well. In the last 18 months, several companies have bought Bitcoin and held it on their balance sheets. These include mid-cap software firms such as MicroStrategy or trillion-dollar heavyweights such as Tesla. Fintech companies such as Square and PayPal have also invested in Bitcoin.

       "  'U.S. Consumer Price Index posts biggest annual rise since 1990  (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin hit another record high and is flirting with $69,000 for the first time after inflation data bolstered the argument that the cryptocurrency is a hedge against rising cost pressures. Most Read from Bloomberg Why Hong Kong Is Building Apartments the Size of Parking Spaces Do Prisons Deserve a Second Chance? COP26 Protests: Inflatable Cows, Megaphones and a Rainbow Farmers Take on ‘Post-Apocalyptic’ Food Crisis The largest digital asset by market value rose as much as 1.9% to $68,991 on Wednesday, topping the previous high set late Monday in New York trading. Other coins also rose, with the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index -- which tracks major cryptos -- gaining as much as 2.4% to its highest level since May. The rise in the token can, at least partly, be explained through the fundamental argument -- which has gained traction in recent months -- that Bitcoin can act as an inflation hedge. Crypto backers argue that, unlike dollars or any other traditional currency, the digital coin is designed to have a limited supply, so it can’t be devalued by a government or a central bank distributing too much of it. “Bitcoin continues to enjoy the rally that began in August and accelerated through September and October,” said Sui Chung, chief executive of CF Benchmarks, a cryptocurrency benchmarks administrator. The latest leg of its rally began in anticipation of the October launch of a Bitcoin-futures ETF, but “seems to now be fueled by the sustained inflation that we are witnessing across all the worlds major economies.” Prices on everything from food to gas to housing have advanced faster and been stickier over the past few months than many economists had anticipated. U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, cementing high inflation as a hallmark of the pandemic recovery and eroding spending power even as wages surge. Major Wall Street players have said they’ve bought the coin -- or become interested in it -- thanks to the inflationary-hedge thesis. Their case has been bolstered',\n",

Featuring SEC Chair Gary Gensler and other business leaders  The hot demand for investment securities linked to bitcoin does not appear to be moving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s stance toward other products more directly linked to the cryptocurrency. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he still has concerns about investor protection in the $2.5 trillion market for crypto assets. “Investors aren’t protected the way they are, whether they go into the stock or bonds markets that we’ve overseen so long,” said Gensler at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit Monday. “Without that, I think it really is, as I’ve said to others, a bit of the Wild West.” Last week, investors were able to invest in the first-ever exchange-traded funds (ETFs) products linked to bitcoin futures contracts. Investors swarmed the new offering; the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was the second largest ever for an ETF. As bitcoin itself surged to record highs, optimism started to build over the prospects of the SEC green-lighting a bitcoin spot ETF. Whereas a bitcoin futures ETF is pinned to options contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, there is no ETF yet available that’s linked to bitcoin itself (referred to as a “spot” or “physical” ETF). Gensler drew this distinction, noting that bitcoin futures themselves are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “It’s a matter of bringing as much of this space within the investor protection remit,” Gensler told Yahoo Finance. A few days after the ProShares debut, digital asset manager Valkyrie launched its own Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF). Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald told Yahoo Finance that with regulators giving a thumbs up to bitcoin futures ETFs, she believed demand was robust enough to bring two or three bitcoin futures products to market. During the week, Grayscale Investments also submitted a filing to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to a bitcoin spot ETF. The move fueled hope that the regulatory lane would soon be opening to spot offerings. But Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said Gensler’s comments show\",\n",

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VentiSwap, a non-custodial cross-chain decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, announces the upcoming launch of its phase two cross-chain NFT marketplace, VentiNFT, soon to launch in Q1 2022. VentiNFT will be the first-ever cross-chain marketplace offering users the ability to buy, sell, swap and mint NFTs on all blockchain supported by the VentiNFT Marketplace. \"Cross-chain interoperability is in demand and a huge factor that is critical to the success of many DeFi projects,\" said Michael Carlin, Co-Founder of VentiSwap. \"We\\'re optimistic that we\\'ve taken the appropriate steps to grow our project and create a platform that is safe and secure and easy to use for users to buy, sell, mint and swap NFTs across different blockchains.\" With VentiSwap, users can swap between Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), Solana (SOL), VentiSwap (VST) and Tether (USDT) with other blockchains to be added in the near future, using one platform and one manually initiated transaction. In October, the company launched a global marketing campaign to spread awareness and improve VentiSwap\\'s brand positioning, featuring ads in airports, transit centers and billboards throughout the U.S. and around the world in countries including the U.K., France, Brazil and Mexico. One of the biggest challenges that newer blockchain projects and applications have today is user adoption; receiving positive findings through an official security audit improves user confidence and enhances the security of decentralized applications. An upcoming audit for VentiSwap will be conducted by Quantstamp, a leading YCombinator-backed blockchain security company that has conducted audit reports for other blockchains including MakerDAO, Prysm and Idle Finance. The VentiSwap team has additional phases planned with future updates including an upcoming VentiWallet, VentiPresale Platform and VentiVault (cold storage device). Currently there is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for its official governance token, VST, with 20,000,000 VST available at a price of $0.18 per token. VST is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 100,000,000. The ICO ends December',\n",

       "  ' This section is Presented by  PayPal        Crypto Roundup: A rundown of some of the biggest stories in crypto this week  The pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto first published the 2008 white paper that led to the creation of Bitcoin. The person or persons was active in Bitcoin’s development until 2010, at which point they disappeared. Many people have claimed to be behind the moniker since, but now a Florida court case alleges the deceased David Kleiman was the man himself. Kleiman’s family is claiming he helped create the popular digital currency and is suing Kleiman’s alleged business partner in the endeavor, Craig Wright, for half of the US$66 billion stake the founders have left untouched in a crypto wallet. Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has been claiming for five years that he helped create Bitcoin, although he has yet to come forward with proof. “We believe the evidence will show there was a partnership to create and mine over one million bitcoin,” Vel Freedman, a lawyer for the Kleiman family, told The Wall Street Journal. According to the suit, Kleiman and Wright formed a partnership and established an entity called W&K Info Defense Research, LLC, that they used to mine bitcoin and organize their intellectual property, including the Bitcoin source code. In emails shown to the court, Wright repeatedly referred to David Kleiman as his “partner” and his “business partner” until after the latter’s death in April 2013. However, depositions from 2019 show Wright decrying the idea of partnership in general. If Wright is Satoshi as he claims, he could easily prove it by retrieving any of the 1.1 million Bitcoins from his supposed wallet. But if he isn’t, or if he has somehow lost access to the wallet in the intervening years, then it’s likely impossible for Kleinman’s family to receive any Bitcoins. Whatever the answer, we won’t have to wait long for a verdict: ten jurors were given three weeks from Nov. 1 to decide the fate of ‘Satoshi’s’ coins.   On Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden’s US$1 trillion',\n",
       "  'NEW YORK (AP) — The cryptocurrency market gets likened to the Wild West by critics, and now a key player is asking for sheriffs to come to town. Binance, the world’s largest exchange for trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, says it’s time for global regulators to establish rules for crypto markets. It released a list of “10 fundamental rights for crypto users” this week that it wants to guide discussions with regulators, policymakers and other exchanges. The company acknowledges that crypto platforms have an obligation to protect users and to implement processes to prevent financial crimes, along with the responsibility to work with regulators and policymakers to set standards to keep users safe. The call for regulation might seem strange for an industry whose popularity exploded in some part precisely because it sought to operate outside the heavy hand of governments and other authorities. But Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who goes by “CZ,” says more regulation for the industry is inevitable, and this allows his company to play a role in the discussions. It may also help draw in people who are still hesitant to get into crypto. “This year, most of the regulators around the world are looking at crypto intently, and many of them are communicating with us,\" Zhao said. “So we feel this is the right time” to issue a call for a global framework. “We feel that it is important for industry players to have a seat at the table,” he said. “And we also feel that some regulations, if they’re made in a vacuum, may not have practical considerations in how they are applied, and they don’t get applied very well.” Regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies has intensified as they’ve grown more mainstream. Big businesses, professional investors and even the government of El Salvador are all buying in, even if critics struggle to see the value of digital currencies created by non-governments. They’re broadening crypto’s base beyond its initial core of fanatics and sent Bitcoin last week to a record high of nearly $68,991, more than doubling in 2021.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell. Tesla CEO and cryptocurrency champion Elon Musk on Thursday posted a raunchy tweet about bitcoin\\'s record high of $69,000 the day before, prompting responses from thousands of users. The cartoon featured a man and a woman in bed watching bitcoin stand at $69,000 on their TV, followed by a comparatively lackluster ether at $4,200. His tweet might have been inspired by the fact that bitcoin rallied to a record of nearly $67,000 on Wednesday, following the successful launch of the ProShares\\' Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first futures fund. Following the launch of the ETF, many market experts believe bitcoin could climb to $80,000 in the near term and even up to $168,000 over the longer term. The billionaire\\'s tweets have in the past caused coins such as bitcoin, dogecoin and even shiba inu to rise in price, although his post on Wednesday didn\\'t elicit much reaction in the market. Tesla holds 42,902 bitcoins now worth almost $2.8 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. However, the company reported it had a $51 million impairment on those holding in the third quarter.

Levchin struck a perhaps more skeptical tone on crypto than Wozniak. \"As crypto and more established coins like bitcoin become part of the vernacular in the retail investing industry, I think it can orient as an asset class,\" Levchin explained. \"I am still fairly skeptical of a rapidly appreciating asset class being used as medium of exchange.

       "  \" With bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) hovering near all-time highs, many analysts are bullish that the flagship cryptocurrencies, and the crypto space as a whole, can continue its rapid growth and ascension for the remainder of the year. And according to Blockchain.com founder Peter Smith, 2022 will see more competition emerge in the industry. “It's very hard to have lost money in crypto over the last year,” Smith said. “Some people have managed to do it, but it's quite hard. And so we're going to get into a harder, more competitive environment, I think, over the next year. And that's actually going to be net good for the market because it's going to start separating the good from the bad.” In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Zack Guzman as part of the Yahoo Finance/Decrypt: Crypto Goes Mainstream summit, Smith discussed his outlook for the crypto industry going into the next year. The summit featured conversations with some of the biggest names in crypto to talk investing, mass adoption, NFT collecting, and how to get started. As for what competition in 2022 may look like, Smith believes that the market will likely begin to gravitate towards crypto platforms that are seeing the highest growth from a usage perspective rather than solely from an investment standpoint. This dynamic would distinguish the “momentum machines” from crypto platforms with “real technical value,” he said. Smith cited how institutions are already beginning to look beyond Ethereum and bitcoin. “So we're seeing volume and flow that's outside Ethereum and bitcoin in our institutional business today, which is really kind of interesting,” Smith said. “And [it] happened a lot faster than we thought it would. That is going to impact prices.” Indeed, other players with major DeFi applications are steadily entering the scene. For instance, Solana (SOL1-USD) has soared in value since the beginning of 2021 as the market cheers the blockchain’s functionality. Originally touted as an “Ethereum killer,” though experts have become increasingly skeptical about the moniker over time, it remains among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap due in part to the platform’s usability.\",\n",

The company anticipates its fund will be the first of at least a couple more, as big and small investors flock to crypto investments. Valkyrie\\'s Bitcoin ETF followed the debut of the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Tuesday with a near-rapturous reception from investors, en route to becoming the second highest-traded ETF debut ever. The attention helped drive Bitcoin\\'s spot price to a fresh record just below $67,000, making any follow-up acts tough to follow. It also drove up BITO\\'s assets under management (AUM) to over $1 billion within less than 2 days.\\xa0 By comparison, Valkyrie\\'s ETF began trading at $25.52 per share, and fell to a low of $24 by Friday’s close. However, the company downplayed the move, preferring to focus on the longer-term implications of new crypto-based products. \"We believe that demand is strong enough to bring two or three Bitcoin futures ETFs to roughly the same AUM given enough time, and then investors will ultimately decide which firm best fits their values and they\\'ll eventually pull ahead of the pack,\" CEO Leah Wald told Yahoo Finance Live.

       "  ' On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal ran a tantalizing headline: “Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Could Be Unmasked at Florida Trial.” Nakamoto, of course, is a pseudonym used by the person or people who laid out the basic principles of Bitcoin, helped develop it between roughly 2008 and 2011, then disappeared with secret identity intact. You would think the Journal’s report on possible new information about Satoshi’s real identity would be welcomed by the cryptocurrency world. You would be mistaken. The headline was greeted with reactions ranging from confusion to withering scorn from major crypto figures including Matthew Graham of Sino Global Capital, Bitcoin educator Matt Odell and author Vijay Boyapati. This article is excerpted from\\xa0The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full\\xa0newsletter here.  The crux of the backlash was at least twofold. First, the headline and much of the story are at best misleading on purely factual grounds. The ongoing civil trial between computer scientist Craig Wright and the estate of former collaborator David Kleiman does not actively consider the question of whether Wright is, as he has claimed for years, Satoshi. The Kleiman estate largely accepts Wright’s claim as part of its standing for the lawsuit, and a verdict either way would not, in itself, amount to a judgment on whether Wright is Satoshi. But more substantively, fury over the Journal story manifests a bone-deep exhaustion among Wright skeptics at having, yet again, to deal with all this. Wright has been making claims to be Satoshi for more than half a decade at this point, but the bitcoin and broader crypto communities have found his evidence consistently unconvincing. Defenses of Wright these days come overwhelmingly from his own affiliates, particularly CoinGeek, the news operation owned by Calvin Ayre, an online-gambling entrepreneur who has faced legal trouble in North America. Ayre is also an investor in nChain, where Wright is chief scientist. nChain develops commercial blockchain services on Bitcoin SV, which forked from Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as part of the long',\n",

According to LinkedIn, U.S. job postings for “crypto” and “blockchain” positions have skyrocketed 615% in August, compared to the same period last year. “We’re seeing this across the big banks and that’s really the sea change over the past few years,” Devin Banerjee, LinkedIn’s editor-at-large of business and finance, told Yahoo Finance. “Big banks were the ones kind of hesitant and scratching their heads over adoption of cryptocurrency and the need for crypto talent, but now they’re getting in the game.” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon publicly expressed his doubts about bitcoin (BTC-USD), the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $1.17 trillion, as recently as last month in an interview, calling it “a little bit of fool’s gold” that has “no intrinsic value,” that regulators would “regulate the hell out of.” Yet despite Dimon’s skepticism, the bank started offering clients access to half a dozen crypto funds in July. Crypto talent hiring by major financial services firms rose 40% in the first half 2021, compared to the same period last year, according to LinkedIn data. The site projects these firms are on pace to add more than three times as many workers with experience in digital assets to their payrolls in 2021 than they did in 2015.

Though both virtual currencies pulled back from their highs in the U.S. session, their trajectory was clearly headed higher. Bitcoin rose as high as $68,564.40 and was last down 0.1% at $67,325 while ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, earlier hit $4,842.65 before trading down 0.7% at $4,774. Both have more than doubled since June and added nearly 70% against the dollar since the start of October. \"This move is a culmination of months of net outflows from exchanges and coming off the market, coupled with increasing demand,\" said Martha Reyes, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange BEQUANT. \"This creates a supply shock and we are far from levels where long-term holders, who make up a greater number of investors, start taking significant profits so $100,000 is on the horizon,\" she added. Market momentum has been gathering since last month\\'s launch of a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the United States raised expectations of flow-driven gains.

       "  ' MIAMI — The civil trial of Ira Kleiman vs. Craig Wright kicked off in Miami on Monday that may provide insight into some of Wright’s claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. Wright, an Australian computer scientist and early cryptocurrency pioneer, has been claiming to be the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin since 2016. This suit posits that Wright did not act alone. According to Ira Kleiman, his late brother David – a fellow computer expert and longtime friend of Wright – was the co-creator of Bitcoin and is entitled to a share of a trove of bitcoin currently valued at $66 billion. The suit alleges that David Kleiman and Wright formed a partnership and established an entity called W&K Info Defense Research, LLC, that they used to mine bitcoin and organize their intellectual property, including the Bitcoin source code. According to emails shown to the jury on Monday, Ira Kleiman alleges that his brother was solely responsible for mining the entire stash of bitcoins in question, and has accused Wright of swindling them through a combination of forgery and deceit from David’s estate after his death. Wright denies the allegations and says that, while David Kleiman was a friend and confidante, the two were never partners and that he alone is Satoshi Nakamoto. A panel of 10 jurors selected Monday will have three weeks to hear the evidence and decide the fate of what Wright’s team is calling “Satoshi’s bitcoins.” In his opening statement on Monday, Kyle Rosche, an attorney for the Kleiman estate, established a timeline for the jury that aimed to demonstrate Wright’s conflicting statements about the nature of his relationship with David Kleiman. In those emails shown to the court, Wright repeatedly referred to David Kleiman as his “partner” and his “business partner” until after the latter’s death in April 2013. Rosche told the jury that after David Kleiman’s death, Wright’s story began to change: he continued to call David his partner but started to distance himself, and claimed that David had transferred their shared intellectual property into Wright’s possession.

       "  'Rivian shares rally for a fifth straight day after high-profile IPO  By John McCrank NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose to a 16-month high on Tuesday after data showed U.S. consumers looked past rising prices and drove retail sales higher than expected last month, while the euro slumped amid growth concerns and a surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe. U.S. retail sales rose 1.7% in October, topping consensus expectations of a 1.4% rise, likely as Americans started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves amid shortages of some goods as the ongoing pandemic squeezes supply chains. At 3:15 p.m. EST, the dollar index was up 0.385% at 95.898, having earlier touched 95.928, its highest since July 2020. The dollar has rallied since U.S. inflation data last week showed consumer prices surged to their highest rate since 1990, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected. \"If you look at U.S. markets, there\\'s a lot more speculation, at least within implied market pricing, that they will be hiking on more than one occasion next year,\" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities. \"After last week’s U.S. CPI report, the dam just broke and the dollar and the FX complex is certainly tagging along for the ride.\" \"Today’s retail sales report only adds fuel to the fire,\" he said. The euro extended losses versus the dollar, last down 0.43% at $1.13175. Earlier in the session, the single currency dropped to $1.1315, its weakest since July 2020. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Monday said that tightening monetary policy now to rein in inflation could choke off the euro zone\\'s recovery, comments which were viewed as pushing back on calls and market bets for tighter policy. The euro\\'s decline reflects the disappointing performance of the euro zone economy relative to the United States, which has been surprising on the upside more than the euro zone has been, said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Holding Ltd.

       "  \" The stock markets are at or near record highs right now, buoyed by a strong investors sentiment, especially among retail investors. Stocks represent a strong return while interest rates and bond yields remain low. But for return-minded investors, stocks are not the only game in town. The notoriously volatile Bitcoin has surged 109% this year, peaking above $65,000 earlier this month. Yet, some crypto watchers believe the digital coin will climb even higher. The cryptocurrency sector is worth approximately $2.6 trillion, globally, and it’s finding fuel from venture capitalists, who poured $5.5 billion into it in the first half of last year only to come back and pump in another $17 billion in the first six months of 2021. That sort of money has to go somewhere, and a large part of it is going to fund the mining operations. The blockchain tech behind crypto doesn’t come cheap – the server farms and mining sites require stacks of high-end computing power, and the cooling infrastructure to keep it in running. This makes Bitcoin miners huge consumers of electricity wherever they operate. They put that power to use running the crypto mining calculations, adding more links to the blockchain and pulling another bitcoin out of the digital ether. And in doing that, the bitcoin mining companies are opening up new avenues for market investors. Against this backdrop, we’ve dipped into the TipRanks database to pull the details on three crypto miners, to find out what’s making them tick. The platform revealed that these are Strong Buy tickers, and, more importantly, all three offer considerable upside potential. Let’s take a closer look.

This crypto miner is based in London and operates 45 megawatts of top-tier bitcoin mining servers in North America, with facilities in Quebec and Texas. The company’s total hashrate of 1075PH puts it in the top 0.7% of bitcoin miners globally, giving Argo a leg up in solving new blockchain calculations and reaping the rewards.

       "  ' JPMorgan has renewed its $146,000 long-term price target for bitcoin, which first made waves in January. The bank says bitcoin is increasingly looking like a digital alternative to gold in the eyes of investors. It said cryptos are \"are an emerging asset class and thus on a multi-year structural uptrend.\" JPMorgan recently published a deep dive into digital assets and it makes for happy reading for crypto fans - albeit with a few caveats. The US\\'s biggest bank has renewed its prediction that bitcoin could surge to $146,000 in the long term, if volatility subsides and institutions start preferring it to gold in their portfolios. That\\'s roughly 130% above Wednesday\\'s price of $63,160. And JPMorgan thinks bitcoin, which is also a scarce product, is increasingly competing with gold for investors\\' attention as a hedge against inflation. (That is, something that will rise even as inflation eats away at the value of other assets.) \"The re-emergence of inflation concerns among investors during September/October 2021 appears to have renewed interest in the usage of bitcoin as an inflation hedge,\" JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said. \"Bitcoin\\'s allure as an inflation hedge has perhaps been strengthened by the failure of gold to respond in recent weeks to heightened concerns over inflation,\" he said. Inflation is running at a 13-year high in the US and has surged around the world. Panigirtzoglou said there is \"little doubt\" the token\\'s competition with gold will continue, as millennials become more powerful in the investing universe, given their preference for cryptocurrencies. \"Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an \\'alternative\\' currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,\" he said, suggesting a long-term price target of $146,000. However, JPMorgan said that for the $146,000 price to come true, bitcoin\\'s huge volatility would have to fall sharply, so that rules-bound investors feel comfortable adding it to their portfolios. Bitcoin\\'s volatility is currently around four to five times higher than gold, the bank said. That would have to fall dramatically before institutional investors plow in.

Subscribe Wednesday, November 10, 2021 On Tuesday, Yahoo Finance joined Decrypt in an effort to spotlight all the ways in which cryptocurrency is now going mainstream. And there are no shortage of headlines trumpeting the ways in which digital coins are capturing the public’s imagination. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is trading above $68,000. Memecoins are less of a joke and more of a legitimate investment. Jobs in the sector are being minted at a frenetic pace. Spot and futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are shaping up to be the next hot thing. And decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital wallets are drawing in legions of small investors, which is drawing out regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Even real estate is getting in on the action. So as new products like ETFs blossom and the blockchain mints new digital coins (Morgan Stanley recently pegged the crypto universe at around 10,000), which agency is best positioned to serve as the sheriff of what SEC Chair Gary Gensler calls the “Wild West” of financial markets? Should regulators graft decades-old securities laws onto a nascent, technologically advanced sector that’s being championed as nothing less than a financial revolution? As the regulatory debate takes shape, there’s at least some credence to an argument made by Ripple executive Asheesh Birla to Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schonberger on Tuesday. Birla said clearer regulations would bolster the industry’s growth, but warned that the desultory application of outdated laws could harm innovation. “I’m not advocating taking old regulation and peanut butter spreading it over cryptocurrency,” he said. “We are advocating for clear regs that are modernized for what blockchain and cryptocurrencies can do and so far it hasn’t been clear.” That theme is particularly resonant, given that Congress is currently weighing a full slate of blockchain-related proposals like oversight of crypto miners',\n",
       "  ' Slowly but surely, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is being used to purchase everyday items like coffee and cars — and now, real estate is also joining the party. The first commercial property in New York is being put on the market for digital coin. Magnum Real Estate Group is selling three retail condos complete with a fully rented-out retail bottom floor in Manhattan’s upper East side for $29 million — but will only accept Bitcoin. Located at 385 First Avenue in a new construction luxury residential building in Gramercy Park, the condos cover 9,000 square feet, and the bottom floor is fully leased by ProHealth, Mighty Pita and M&T Bank. “There’s a demand for real estate and there’s nothing being offered to the holders of crypto,” Ben Shaoul, managing partner of Magnum Real Estate Group, told Yahoo Finance. “Our idea is to offer something that’s unique and try to pair the holders of crypto with those who want to sell real estate,” he added. This isn’t the first crypto transaction for Shaoul. He did three residential deals in 2018, including the sale of an Upper East Side retail condo for $15.3 million in Bitcoin. And Shaoul expects real estate transactions using crypto to grow. “I see the runway for transactions with crypto increasing exponentially,” said Shaoul. “The fact that bitcoin is at record highs helps, but I also think investors have done very well owning bitcoin and now they’re looking for cash flow in assets and [real estate] gives someone the ability to buy a long-term real property with cash flow so they can take some chips off the table or transact and sell the asset in a few years as it’s appreciated in value to another buyer of crypto,” he added. Shaun Pappas, Partner at real estate law firm Starr Associates LLP, likens acquiring real estate using crypto to backward diversification with dividends. “Commercial sales with crypto were the logical next move as this section of the market matures,” Pappas explained. “Commercial real estate in NYC, especially in this location, will be there forever.

Bitcoin was down 5% at $60,391.3 at 1253 GMT, after earlier falling as much as $58,563, its lowest since Oct. 28, while Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 6.8% at $4,253.08. Cryptocurrency analysts could not identify any particular news driving the falls, which they said seemed to be driven by profit taking after a recent sharp run-up. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value since June, driven by the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and the launch in the United States of futures-based bitcoin exchange traded funds. And on Sunday it went through a major upgrade, called Taproot, that enables its blockchain to execute more complex transactions, potentially widening the virtual currency\\'s use cases and making it a little more competitive with ethereum for processing smart contracts. \"The fall below 60,000, puts (Bitcoin) below the 62,000 support level, slightly into the \\'short term\\' bearish zone,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs in New York. \"The next key support level is 58,000, but I think it gets bought up here, and demand driven prices will begin to play out to the upside.\" Most investors expect bitcoin to remain between $50,000 to $75,000 in the next 12 months, according to BofA Securities\\' monthly fund manager survey, while 59% believe bitcoin is in a bubble.

As risk-sensitive assets plunged, the leading digital coin shed over $3,000, changing hands just below $44,000 in midday trading. The moves were the latest signal that the world’s largest cryptocurrency hasn’t achieved the “safe haven” asset status that some of its more ardent proponents have promoted, even as debt levels around the world surge in response to COVID-19. With the virus still dominating investor concerns, markets were jolted by news of Evergrande, a major Chinese real estate company that\\'s teetering on the brink of default. China\\'s potentially slowing economy, and Beijing\\'s aggressive actions against key business sectors, have converged with worries about the global economy. Meanwhile, a fight is brewing in Washington over raising the U.S. debt limit. The spillover effects were apparent across the crypto world. According to CoinmarketCap, top payment networks such as Ethereum (ETH-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), Binance Coin (BNB-USD) and Solana (SOL1-USD) have all sustained even deeper losses than bitcoin in the past 24 hours: all were off by at least 8% on the day.\\xa0 According to blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, the 7-day moving average for the number of Bitcoin wallet addresses sending money to crypto exchanges has reached a 3-month high, signaling intensifying selling pressure and speculative trading.\\xa0 Given the fees associated with moving crypto on and off most centralized crypto exchanges, this rising flow volume to exchanges is one indicator that BTC holders could be looking to sell. Meanwhile, overall balance of crypto on exchanges continues to decline this week.

       "  ' As bitcoin blasted through new all-time highs Wednesday, the following joke made the rounds. Jamie Dimon walks into a bar and orders a martini. “Bitcoin or cash?” asks the bartender. “You want to know my opinion on bitcoin?” says the JPMorgan CEO. “It’s worthless.” The bartender replies: “I know, but tell me anyway.” Every big run-up in bitcoin’s price prompts another debate about whether the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ($1.26 trillion, according to the latest CoinDesk data) is worth anything at all. However, the likes of Dimon and other boomers are wrong when they say bitcoin is worth nothing. I have no idea where the price is headed (no one knows, really), what the “true” value is or whether it’s well below or well above current levels. (As always, do your own research and do not put in more than you afford to lose.) All I know is that it’s greater than zero, for the following reasons: Bitcoin allows for the quick, trustless transmission of value without the need for a middleman. It is a way to transact value (and data) among people without the meddling of governments or corporations. I could go on and on about why this is valuable, as I have for years, but don’t take my word for it. Ask WikiLeaks. Ask OnlyFans. Ask Meduza, the Russian news outlet that was branded a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin and turned to bitcoin and other crypto donations to weather the resulting hit to its advertising business. Simply put, bitcoin is censorship-resistant in an era of creeping financial censorship. That is worth something. Bitcoin is difficult to confiscate. Not impossible, but difficult. It requires the would-be confiscator to get ahold of the cryptographic private keys to a bitcoin wallet, which in turn requires the cooperation of the keyholder (assuming the person has properly secured his or her keys). That helps explain bitcoin’s appeal to people living under repressive regimes, and even in the West there are edge cases where this quality could prove advantageous – say, by preventing a prosecutor from unilaterally freezing all',\n",
       "  ' It’s been a broadly bearish morning session for Bitcoin and the broader market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin, BTC to USD, was down by 2.39% to $61,397.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $63,067.0 before hitting reverse. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $64,252, Bitcoin fell to a late morning low $61,277.0. Steering clear of the first major support level at $60,862, however, Bitcoin revisited $61,900 levels before easing back. It’s been a mixed morning for the rest of the majors. Crypto.com Coin was up by 7.88% to lead the way. Bitcoin Cash SV (+0.17%) and Polkadot (+0.55%) also found morning support. It has been a bearish morning for the rest of the majors, however. At the time of writing, Chainlink was down by 3.76% to lead the way down. Binance Coin (-2.07%), Cardano’s ADA (-2.21%), Ethereum (-2.06%), Litecoin (-2.64%), and Ripple’s XRP (-1.90%) also struggled. Through the early hours, the crypto total market cap rose to an early morning high $2,746bn before falling to a late morning low $2,690. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $2,688bn. Bitcoin’s dominance rose to an early morning high 43.43% before falling to a low 43.10%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 43.15%. Bitcoin would need to move back through the $62,213 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $64,252 and $65,000 levels into play. Support from the broader market will be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from $63,500 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance at $64,252 would likely cap any upside. In the event of another extended rally through the afternoon, Bitcoin could test resistance at $68,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $65,603. Failure to move back through the $62,213 pivot would bring the first major support level at $60,862 back into play. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$60,000 levels. The second major support level sits at $58,823. Looking beyond',\n",
       "  ' VANCOUVER, British Columbia, October 26, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mogo Inc. (NASDAQ:MOGO) (TSX:MOGO) (\"Mogo\" or the \"Company\"), a digital payments and financial technology company, has launched ‘green’ bitcoin, an initiative which makes all bitcoin purchased on the Mogo platform climate positive. For every bitcoin purchased through its platform, Mogo will plant enough trees to completely offset the CO2 emissions produced by mining that bitcoin —and then some. This initiative, believed to be the first of its kind, also includes all bitcoin currently held by members on the platform. Mogo’s ‘green’ bitcoin further demonstrates the Company’s commitment to creating a healthier planet while empowering Canadians to invest and spend wisely. The global market for cryptocurrencies recently grew to a record high of over US$2.7 trillion, and bitcoin alone accounted for approximately 50% of that value. So far in October, bitcoin’s average 24-hour trading volume has exceeded US$37 billion. Bitcoin has great potential for investors that value ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles, but its environmental impact remains a barrier; bitcoin mining uses as much power annually as the entire country of Sweden. This negative impact discourages many Canadians from adding bitcoin to their portfolios. While some miners are embracing green energy at the source, approximately 18.8 million bitcoins have already been mined to date; for each bitcoin mined, an estimated 421,000 lbs of CO2 emissions are released into our atmosphere2. To address the magnitude of this problem, Mogo will plant trees to offset 500,000 lbs of CO2 for each bitcoin on its platform. This action offsets 79,000 lbs of CO2 more than is produced by mining each bitcoin, and effectively turns a Mogo bitcoin investment into climate action. \"Bitcoin is the best performing asset class of the past decade with massive inflows of capital daily,\" said David Feller, CEO of Mogo. \"But the tremendous potential of bitcoin is hindered by its environmental impact; the emissions created by mining are among the greatest problems facing this asset class today. By launching ‘green’ bitcoin, we’ve made buying bitcoin good for the planet and arguably one of the most ESG-oriented investments anyone can make.\" Mogo has',\n",

This, in conjunction with recent miner deliveries and ongoing fleet optimization, contributed to our achieving a record hashrate of 1.8 exahash per second (EH/s) in late October,” said Emiliano Grodzki, Bitfarms Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “With new miner deliveries en route and deliveries continuing throughout November, this month we expect to grow our hashrate to over 2 EH/s and improve our electrical efficiency to 44 watts per terahash (W/TH).” October 2021 Bitfarms’ Mining Production Update  1.8 EH/s achieved effective October 25, 2021. 343 new Bitcoin (BTC) mined during October 2021. 2,750 BTC mined in the first ten months of 2021. 11+ BTC mined daily on average, equivalent to about US$ 665,500 per day based on a BTC price of US$60,500 on October 31. 2,646 BTC deposited into custody for the year through October 31, 2021, representing approximately 96% of Bitfarms’ 2021 BTC production with a total value of approximately US$160 million based on a BTC price of US$60,500.

       "  ' Taproot, a privacy and scalability upgrade Bitcoin developers have long been drooling over, finally activated last weekend. But more upgrades are in the pipeline, being worked on by developers behind the scenes. Taproot is a particularly big upgrade in Bitcoin, called a “soft fork,” which isn’t executed all that often in Bitcoinland. Before Taproot, the last soft fork was SegWit, which activated on Bitcoin four years ago. Soft forks aren’t all that common. Nonetheless, they are an important type of upgrade that has repercussions for many projects building on top of Bitcoin, iteratively improving functionality of the open source digital currency. Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Its Tech Stack So, what could be next, after Taproot? In fact, developers have been eyeing many other important soft fork changes to Bitcoin over the years. Though, as a quick aside, it’s worth mentioning that even though Taproot has now activated, the work for Taproot is far from over. To use Taproot transactions, Bitcoin wallets, exchanges and other services will need to upgrade to support them. Plus, many of the changes developers have been eyeing that rely on Taproot, still need to be made. But even if some exchanges and wallets have yet to adopt Taproot, some like BitGo and Blockstream Green have been speedier, and more than 50 percent of nodes supporting Bitcoin are running the upgraded software. Still, for a long view of what’s in store for Bitcoin, let’s take a look at some of the other possible soft fork changes that are in the pipeline. SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, described in detail in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 118, looks like someone is shouting gibberish at you via text. But the change is much less dramatic than it looks. In short, it allows a new type of signing option when signing a transaction, allowing a user to sign a transaction without adding a specific output (which is the coins they want to send) – at least not right away. This code change helps with a variety of technical problems, including one facing the Lightning Network, the overlay network to Bitcoin',\n",

But what sparked the sell-off is still up for debate, with a few different theories floating around. The crypto crash was most likely the combined result of a few events. Gilbert said the sell-off may have been the result of the passing of a new infrastructure bill in the United States which was officially signed by President Joe Biden. “The bill includes tax reporting and provisions that apply to crypto-assets and NFTs,” Gilbert said. Another factor was the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US quashing VanEck’s attempt to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A spot Bitcoin ETF would be one that is “physically backed” by the crypto by investing directly in it. This is different from the recently launched Bitcoin Futures ETF which does not directly own Bitcoin, but rather buys futures contracts, which is an agreement to buy or sell the asset later at an agreed price. Either way, VanEck has launched its own Bitcoin Futures ETF overnight while it continues to aim for the spot Bitcoin ETF. “VanEck Bitcoin Strategy Futures ETF will go live this week in the US, and investors are',\n",
       "  ' VanEck\\'s Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF), the third Bitcoin-based futures fund to hit the market recently, rallied in its second day of trading as the volatile but booming cryptocurrency market draws in more investors. Launched on Tuesday with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the product (XBTF) will own Bitcoin futures contracts. While not as hotly anticipated as the spot Bitcoin ETF the firm has doggedly pursued for years, XBTF carries competitive cost and tax advantages that may turn it into a hit for financial advisors, as well as smaller investors seeking exposure to the hot crypto market. The first Bitcoin ETF issued by Proshares (BITO) launched on October 19. BITO\\'s total assets under management (AUM) swelled to above $1 billion in less than two days, and coincided with Bitcoin\\'s spot price setting a fresh record — making for a tough follow-up act. By holding BTC futures contracts from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in each fund, the composition of these products isn\\'t meaningfully different. It also explains why an issuer\\'s success at launching a Bitcoin ETF has depended so much on releasing the product before competitors. \"With each new Bitcoin futures-based ETF, the impact for the entire cryptocurrency market is diminishing,\" Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst with Oanda, told Yahoo Finance. The latest fund offers at least one competitive advantage according to Moya, which might provide a catalyst for its success — fees are cheaper. While BITO and Valkyrie\\'s fund (BTF) both carry fee requirements of 0.95%, XBTF only costs 0.65%. \"Even though our product is third to market, we feel the benefits our product brings outweigh the timing,\" said Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets products with VanEck. Along with lower fees, DaCruz also pointed to the difference in tax structure between VanEck\\'s ETF and its competitors.\\xa0 Unlike most ETFs regulated under the 1940s securities law, VanEck\\'s fund is regulated as a C-Corporation, which means it could provide better tax advantages for long-term investors.

With the Mastercard partnership, companies will also be able to offer crypto as part of their loyalty reward programs backed by Bakkt. For instance, hotels or restaurants who offer points for freebies or other perks could also offer customers the option to convert the points into cryptocurrency of their choosing. The partnership comes as more Americans become interested in transacting in digital assets, with businesses and service providers making incremental steps toward making it easier to transact in crypto. Nearly half of respondents purchased crypto in the first half of 2021, according to a Bakkt survey of 2000 consumers. And, according to the Mastercard New Payments Index, 77% of millennials stated that they are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency, with 75% saying that they would use cryptocurrency if they understood it better. The partnership with Mastercard comes after Bakkt partnered with Google to allow its users to purchase goods and services using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the Google Pay wallet and payment system. Bakkt, which started as a cryptocurrency exchange for institutional investors, has moved into the consumer space with an app aimed at being a tool to let people manage their digital assets — including cryptocurrencies – similar to Venmo.

The proceeds from the sale will be put toward paying back victims of the BitConnect scam. In 2017, BitConnect's founder and its promoters swindled investors out of $2 billion. Victims of the biggest heist in the cryptocurrency world may soon get some retribution. That's because the US Justice Department is selling $56 million worth of cryptocurrency it seized as part of its case against BitConnect, according to a Tuesday press release. The founder of BitConnect, a scam cryptocurrency, and its promoters swindled thousands of people out of $2 billion worth of bitcoin in 2017. The scheme is the largest cryptocurrency fraud ever criminally charged, the Justice Department said in its statement. The proceeds from the sale will be used to help pay back victims of the scam. The crypto to be sold was seized from BitConnect's top promoter, 44-year-old Glenn Arcaro, who pleaded guilty in federal criminal court for his role in the case. Insider previously reported that he and BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani told investors the coin could get monthly returns as high as 40%. In September, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Kumbhani for raising $2 billion from investors in an offering not properly registered with regulators. In May, the SEC sued five BitConnect promoters who created video testimonials on YouTube and received commissions from it. Arcaro, for his part, received $24 million in referral comissions, Insider said previously. Experts have been advising investors to remain vigilant in the crypto world. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies rises, so does the number of scams. Insider reported in July one 77-year-old woman lost more than $12,000 in a bitcoin scam.

Preliminary Third Quarter 2021 Highlights We completed our fleet\\'s exit from China. As of the date of this press release, 100% of our fleet had arrived in North America. As of September 30, 2021, we had no miners remaining in China: 79.1% of our miner fleet was already deployed or awaiting installation in North America, and 20.9% was in transit.

The 0.318 EH/s reduction in the third quarter was due to fleet repositioning, in which the Company sold or disposed of certain models (partially offset by purchases) in anticipation of purchase opportunities. The Company recognized a $0.375 million gain on miner sales, and the net sale proceeds had been reinvested into miner purchases as of the date of this press release. The Company purchased 851 miners on the spot market during the quarter.

The previously announced purchases are expected to increase Bit Digital\\'s maximum hash rate by approximately 1.0 EH/s. Pro forma for the announced purchases, our maximum total hash rate is expected to be approximately 2.603 EH/s. The Company earned 248.36 bitcoins. The reduction from the second quarter was due to the migration program, in which a higher percentage of fleet capacity was offline while in transit to, or awaiting installation in, North America, as well as miner sales and disposals.

According to Bank of America data that tracks social media crypto trends, Reddit/Twitter token mentions put Shiba Inu and Dogecoin among the top 5 for October with the largest month over month change in mentions.\\xa0 Yet not everyone is on board. “I’d prefer to stay away from any of that stuff,” Geoff Golberg, a crypto investor and CEO of social analytics firm, Social Forensics, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\\xa0 Golberg, who got into cryptocurrencies in 2015, isn’t nearly as excited by Shiba Inu or Dogecoin as other retail buyers. “I’m interested in cryptocurrency for the long term,” he said.\\xa0 On the one hand, Golberg suggested these “meme coins” serve as a way to get more people interested in cryptocurrency, because they’re fun and enticing.\\xa0 Still, the other side of a skyrocketing trade like Shiba could easily spell disaster. “A lot of people are going to get burnt and maybe that will leave them with a sour taste for crypto,” Golberg added. Currently Shiba Inu is worth a fraction of a cent, 5 decimal places from a single dollar, ($0.00007336 to be exact). This makes the token something like a penny stock except as a cryptocurrency — and SHIB carries even less regulatory guardrails. The coin is so',\n",
       "  \"VICTORIA, Seychelles , Nov. 11, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProBit Global has announced its completed integration with automated DCA bot service Deltabadger on November 3, 2021, as part of its latest partnership to strengthen API trading services for its users. Deltabadger enables cryptocurrency traders to set up automated, long-term dollar-cost averaging strategies through strategically recurring buy and sell order cycles with a full range of time and price parameters at their disposal. As of press time, Deltabadger currently hosts 1,349 active bots, of which all bots running DCA over the past year are generating profits. BTC remains the top choice for DCA investors with 127.6 BTC in total being implemented towards fully-calibrated DCA strategies as digital gold continues to reach all-time marks. A convenient interface displays key analytics for investors to detail the current total amount purchased, the average price of purchases, total investment amount, current investment value, as well as a P/L metric to track overall growth. The DCA strategy can be an equalizing tool for newer traders, removing common barriers such as technical analysis and market assessment needed to enter a position. While some traders endorse a higher risk, higher rewards approach through a lump-sum purchase, DCA involves a steady buildup focused on minimizing risk through smaller, recurring purchases made over a consistent time frame. DCA is often endorsed as a way of hedging against market volatility while remaining in a position to capture the upticks. To further illustrate, a DCA strategy with a recurring daily purchase of $100 in BTC over the past year generated a 70% increase based on calculations by dcaBTC. ProBit Global users can set up bots by adding API keys to the Deltabadger interface to execute automated transactions for over 700 tokens. The API service provides full customization options ranging from smart intervals and customized price ranges to optimize the accumulation of accrued purchases spread out over an hourly, daily, weekly, or yearly cycle. Deltabadger’s signature smart interval option will automatically place either buy or sell orders at ProBit Global's minimum order size of 1 USDT by utilizing flexible purchasing intervals.

Until October 30, Saturday, at 11:59 p.m. CT, every person who downloads the app, enters a promo code, deposits $100, and makes a trade will get $100 worth of bitcoin, Bobby Karalla, the NBA team's digital content manager, tweeted. The cryptocurrency platform on Wednesday announced a five-year partnership with the basketball team. The deal includes the right to name the Mavs Gaming Hub, the official gaming and event venue for the Mavs' NBA 2K League team. The platform teamed up with the Mavs because of their leadership in the NBA and Cuban's deep understanding of digital assets, Voyager CEO and cofounder Steve Ehrlich said in a statement. Cuban has been outspoken about his crypto beliefs, recently touting dogecoin as a fun investment and likening the crypto boom to the dot-com bubble. Voyager Digital, founded in 2018, allows its over 2 million verified users to trade over 60 currencies. The platform joins the growing number of crypto firms looking to tap into the sports industry.

This time around, the 49 year-old dyed-in-the-wool Libertarian honed his agenda to focus on cryptocurrencies — with the Shiba Inu digital coin taking center stage, and China\\'s crypto mining crackdown the impetus for his ambitions. He\\'s part of a vanguard of crypto-friendly politicians looking to use the booming digital coin movement to forge a path to Washington. Bray\\'s call to politics hit him back in 2019, the candidate explained to Yahoo Finance in a recent interview. He\\'d been furloughed for two months as a cyber security analyst at the U.S. Department of Defense thanks to what turned out to be the longest government shutdown in the country\\'s history. Fed up and \"not getting paid,\" Bray discovered a North Carolina seat in the Senate had opened up and, temporarily without work, thought he might be able to fix the inefficiencies of government at the legislative level. In what he referred to as an \"eye opening\" experience that got him \"hooked\" on politics, Bray received a paltry 3% of the vote in an attempt to challenge Republican incumbent Thom Tillis. While some might have deemed it \"an embarrassing loss\" (his exact words), Bray maintained that his first act of running for the Libertarian party kept open ballot access for his party\\'s voters. His positions include being anti-war, pro-immigration, savvy on cyber security issues like ransomware and adamant about curbing the size of the federal government — even as a worker whose spent most of his adult life working for the federal government. Bray does not claim to be a cryptocurrency expert. But his status as a Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) holder since September has made him something of an overnight celebrity, which has boosted a donation he\\'s made towards struggling veterans.

The S&P 500 also hovered near a record level and logged sixth straight day of gains, marking its longest winning streak since the beginning of July.\\xa0 Bitcoin (BTC) prices rose above $66,000 to set a fresh all-time high. The cryptocurrency held onto gains from earlier this week, after the first-ever Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund, or the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), rose by nearly 5% in its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) fell despite posting third-quarter earnings and subscriber growth that exceeded Wall Street\\'s expectations. United Air Lines (UAL) shares rose after the carrier delivered a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue that topped expectations, albeit while remaining some 32% below 2019 levels.\\xa0 These better-than-feared earnings results — in addition to those from earlier reporters including the big banks last week, and Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson earlier this week — have helped assuage traders\\' concerns that corporate profits would slow dramatically after a second-quarter surge. Investors have been nervously monitoring inflation data showing prices jumping by the most in decades, on top of a myriad reports over persistent labor and materials shortages and delivery issues.

That’s because the U.S. has 40% more foreign cash in the system from two years or even 18 months ago, he said. “I’m a monetarist at heart. I believe, if you increase the money supply by 40%, you’re going to have a 40% depreciation in purchasing power, roughly thereabouts,” he said. And while the amount of appreciation in real estate has been unprecedented over the past two years, in order for a bubble to form, “it’s going to have to get to many multiples of people’s income” — tough with more jobs than people right now. In our\\xa0call of the day, Bass said he thinks investors should be sticking cash in one crucial place. “I think assets, including real estate, are going to continue to move much higher over the next decade because I think the central banks can’t raise rates more than 100 basis points,” he said. But as individuals see the value of their dollar depreciate — and he’s especially worried about hydrocarbons and food inflation in the next year — forget bitcoin as the “perfect substitute or a great substitute for gold and/or an inflation protector.” Bass said “from here on out, it’s going to be really difficult to make money” on bitcoin due to “intense regulation” he sees coming in 2022 from the U.S. government, following\\xa0China’s crackdowns this year. “I think that the blockchain, I think that NFTs [nonfungible tokens], those things are all very much here to stay.

       "  ' VanEck\\'s Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF), the third Bitcoin-based futures fund to hit the market recently, rallied in its second day of trading as the volatile but booming cryptocurrency market draws in more investors. Launched on Tuesday with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the product (XBTF) will own Bitcoin futures contracts. While not as hotly anticipated as the spot Bitcoin ETF the firm has doggedly pursued for years, XBTF carries competitive cost and tax advantages that may turn it into a hit for financial advisors, as well as smaller investors seeking exposure to the hot crypto market. The first Bitcoin ETF issued by Proshares (BITO) launched on October 19. BITO\\'s total assets under management (AUM) swelled to above $1 billion in less than two days, and coincided with Bitcoin\\'s spot price setting a fresh record — making for a tough follow-up act. By holding BTC futures contracts from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in each fund, the composition of these products isn\\'t meaningfully different. It also explains why an issuer\\'s success at launching a Bitcoin ETF has depended so much on releasing the product before competitors. \"With each new Bitcoin futures-based ETF, the impact for the entire cryptocurrency market is diminishing,\" Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst with Oanda, told Yahoo Finance. The latest fund offers at least one competitive advantage according to Moya, which might provide a catalyst for its success — fees are cheaper. While BITO and Valkyrie\\'s fund (BTF) both carry fee requirements of 0.95%, XBTF only costs 0.65%. \"Even though our product is third to market, we feel the benefits our product brings outweigh the timing,\" said Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets products with VanEck. Along with lower fees, DaCruz also pointed to the difference in tax structure between VanEck\\'s ETF and its competitors.\\xa0 Unlike most ETFs regulated under the 1940s securities law, VanEck\\'s fund is regulated as a C-Corporation, which means it could provide better tax advantages for long-term investors. Part of the C-structure\\'s appeal involves letting investors allocate their losses between years of high and low return.\\xa0 That means in a bad',\n",
       "  ' We’re approaching Christmas and many expect the art of window dressing to take hold. No, not on the streets of our towns, where shops prepare far too early for holiday sales.

You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday. Is that what could be coming for the cryptocurrency markets in the next few weeks? If past mutual fund behavior is any guide, window dressing may not be a driving factor but there are still things portfolio managers do – or don’t do – that help drive up asset prices in their portfolios before New Year’s Eve. For those unfamiliar with the theory, window dressing is the idea that portfolio managers sell their losing positions and buy more of their winners ahead of year-end reporting so they look like they’ve been making all the right moves. Among other consequences, that could punish already-losing securities and pump winners even higher. Many studies have been done suggesting that may be the case, but they usually use quarter-end data to come up with their conclusions. However, one study published in 2014 in the Review of Financial Studies used actual mutual fund equity trading data from 1999 to 2010. While not finding evidence of typical window dressing, researchers Gang Hu, R. David McLean, Jeffrey Pontiff and Qinghai Wang found something more nuanced. “We find that both abnormally high institutional buying and abnormally low institutional selling are associated with price inflation,” they wrote. “We further show that the portion of buy trades increases sharply on quarter-end, and especially year-end, days. Further analyses reveal that institutional buying declines at year end, whereas institutional selling has an even larger decline at year end, thereby creating the high portion of buys.” Basically, funds were increasing buys of their bigger stock positions up to near the year end, but they stopped selling at an',\n",

(OTC: SWRM), a software development company and aggregator of mobile applications, announces plans to launch cryptocurrency mining operations through TulsaLabs. AppSwarm, through its blockchain advisor Data Syndicate, will work on developing out an initial cryptocurrency mining operation for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Phase One: Rig Miners The Company will look to immediately purchase and deploy ASIC miner rigs that are made for the purpose of mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Dogecoin and Litecoin use a hashing algorithm called Scrypt, which is less complex than SHA-256. This makes mining Litecoin and Dogecoin much faster and less energy-intensive than Bitcoin. Phase Two: Co-Location Mining Pools The Company will then look to expand its mining operations by purchasing and hosting additional rigs at co-location facilities within the region and participate in mining pool operations. DogeLabs will explore launching its own Dogecoin mining pool, which would be a network of individual miners who mine the cryptocurrency as a single entity, or node, by merging their computing power. The rewards would then be distributed among pool participants proportionally by the amount of computer power committed by each miner. Phase Three: Mining Facilities The Company will also explore developing its own co-location mining facility that utilizes renewable energy sources, with power back-up, and AC cooling in the Tulsa, Oklahoma region. In its final stage, the Company will explore partnerships with natural gas and solar operators in the Oklahoma region interested in collaborating on providing energy to power a larger scale mining facility in the region. ESG Review The Company will establish an Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) review of mining operations to adhere to its commitment to technology for the betterment of mankind, and the environment. We will explore mining options such as projects that require lower kilowatt-hour demand and the use of renewable energy to offset the carbon footprint of operations.

Businesses of all sizes are always looking for exciting and relevant ways to promote their products – and now green bitcoin rewards can be one of them.

Mogo is now able to partner with businesses across Canada that want to incorporate bitcoin into their promotions and, importantly, do so in a sustainable way. \"We believe green bitcoin is a much more appealing reward for the next generation of Canadians, and we’re pleased to facilitate simple access to it in a fun and engaging way to support the goals of business customers,\" said Phil Barrar from Mogo. \"This kind of rewards program can work within a business’ existing rewards program and potentially help drive long-term financial benefit to their customers.

       "  \" As the cryptocurrency world awaits the Biden administration’s proposals for how to regulate stablecoins, one of the industry’s biggest lobbying groups is out with a wish list of what regulation should look like. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose values are tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, precious metals, or short-term securities, are a way to mitigate the inherent volatility of digital coins. They are used by traders to get in and out of trades, and are increasingly being used for more traditional banking products like savings accounts – yet there’s little regulatory oversight or FDIC backing. In a new 17-page letter to top officials at the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission, the Chamber of Digital Commerce argues that stablecoins should not be regulated as securities or money market funds. Rather the asset class should be regulated as payment systems by standardizing the current system of oversight using money transmission licensing laws applied at the state level, according to the organization, which counts major stablecoin issuers like Binance.US, Circle and more traditional financial players Citigroup and Mastercard among its executive committee. “Stablecoins are a critical component of the crypto ecosystem and essential that any new policies or regulations allow this technology to grow in a sustainable way,” said Perianne Boring, the Chamber’s founder and president. “It’s really important we get this right. If we get policy recommendations that don’t allow for stablecoins to operate as payment system instruments it will be pushed overseas,” she added. The crypto industry’s recommendations come as President Joe Biden’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) — comprised of the Treasury, Fed, SEC and other major U.S. financial regulators — is expected to issue a report soon with recommendations for a regulatory framework for stablecoins. This week, Bloomberg reported the SEC will have significant authority over regulating stablecoins. But an official involved in the report told Yahoo Finance the SEC won't be granted new authority to oversee stablecoins, and will likely restate what the SEC's existing authorities already are. Regulators have been considering applying new rules to regulate stablecoins akin to those\",\n",

We will be announcing other exchanges to reach wider audiences and improve the acceptance of digital assets across the world,\" said Donald Basile, Founder of Bitcoin Latinum and CEO of Monsoon Blockchain Corporation. Bitcoin Latinum is an insured asset-backed cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Developed by Monsoon Blockchain Corporation on behalf of Bitcoin Latinum Foundation, LTNM is a greener, faster, and more secure version of Bitcoin, capable of managing massive crypto transactions while being highly efficient in terms of cost and scalability. As a revolutionary new Bitcoin blockchain-based token, LTNM focuses on disrupting high-growth industries like Media, Gaming, Telecommunications, and Cloud Computing. Improving on Bitcoin\\'s energy-usage concerns, LTNM utilizes a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm to achieve consensus, which not only increases the TPS rate of the network but also significantly minimizes the fee. Besides, unlike other crypto assets, LTNM is insured, and backed by real-world and digital assets. Its asset backing is held in a fund model so that base asset value increases over time. It accelerates this asset-backed funds growth by depositing 80% of the transaction fee back into the asset fund that backs the currency. Thus, the more Bitcoin Latinum is adopted, the faster its asset funds grow, creating a self-inflating currency. Furthermore, users and businesses can unlock new revenue streams while lowering their transactional costs. The listing on Hotbit highlights the Bitcoin Latinum Foundation\\'s',\n",

       "  ' Bitcoin (BTC-USD) may finish 2021 defined by the same vertigo-inducing price action that took it from under $30,000 to a fresh record near $66,000 within the space of a few months, analysts say. On Thursday, investors booking profits in the wake of the successful launch of two Bitcoin futures-based exchange traded funds (ETFs) last week dragged the digital coin down by about 5% on the day. More new funds are expected to hit the market from issuers like VanEck, Galaxy Digital and Bitwise, leading many investors to believe the price has more room to run up in 2021. Meanwhile, leveraged investors also liquidated positions on future Bitcoin bets. Leverage is money borrowed from an exchange or market maker that allows a trader to increase both the gains and losses they might receive from buying a specific asset. With more than $185 million of BTC liquidations in the last 24 hours, according to ByBit, analysts expect more short-term volatility as the year ends.\\xa0\\xa0 “I am expecting weekly moves over $20,000 each way as we close out the year,” wrote Nik Bhatia, author of the macro-economics focused newsletter, Layered Money, on Tuesday. To be sure, this most recent BTC price swing is paltry relative to the $4.87 billion liquidated on April 15, the year’s worst day for BTC derivatives traders.\\xa0 Yet both movements, as well as the $1.2 billion liquidation in levered positions that occurred in early September, come with an obvious lesson: highly levered Bitcoin positions can lead to a cascade of selling that can ultimately sink the spot price. One major cause of liquidations in the options and futures market is the cost for holding a levered position, which is high. If these margins grow too pricey for traders taking long positions, they can decide to liquidate their position instead of paying the margin. \"It could be unexpected events that really changes the mood of the market. Also, if leverage keeps building and expectations get higher and higher than those expectations alone not being filled and having so much money behind them can cause a significant correction,” Sui Chung,',\n",
       "  'The cost of the new programs, which will run from Oct. 24 to May 7, will be $7.4 billion  Written by Aditya Raghunath at The Motley Fool Canada As Bitcoin has soared to record highs, cryptocurrency mining stocks have also gained significant momentum in recent trading sessions. Shares of HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSXV:HIVE)(NASDAQ:HVBT) and Hut 8 Mining (TSX:HUT)(NASDAQ:HUT) are up 38% and 33%, respectively, in the last month. In the last year, HIVE has gained over 1,000%, while Hut 8 stock has risen by 1,390%. If you are bullish on the cryptocurrency space, it makes sense to look closely at the companies that mine these digital assets. Let’s see which between HIVE Blockchain and Hut 8 Mining is a good bet right now. Valued at a market cap of $1.88 billion, HIVE Blockchain Technologies operates as a cryptocurrency mining company. It mines digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The rising prices of cryptocurrencies have allowed HIVE to increase revenue from $16.35 million in fiscal 2019 to over $100 million in fiscal 2021 (ending in March). In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, gross sales from currency mining rose by 466% year over year to $37.2 million while net income was up more than 10 times to $18.6 million. HIVE is one of the few companies that mines both Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing investors with diversification. In Q1 of fiscal 2022, the company mined 225 Bitcoin and 97,000 Ethereum. It ended the quarter with digital currency assets of $82.2 million. HIVE Blockchain’s gross margin in Q1 rose to $31 million, or 83% of sales, compared to $2.5 million, or 39% of sales, in the year-ago period. The improvement in gross mining margin was attributed to HIVE’s assumption of control over its operations in Sweden in fiscal 2020, which resulted in lower costs as well as the switch to independent mining at its Bitcoin facility in Quebec. The gross margin depends on a variety of factors that include mining difficulty, the amount of currency rewards, and the market price of the underlying asset.

FCC is Canada\\'s first Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) regulated entity to offer this digital currency trading and custody solution dedicated for institutional investors, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Leveraging this new platform, Fidelity Investments Canada ULC filed preliminary prospectuses for Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF™ and Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF Fund™. With digital asset valuations reaching all-time highs and an increasing interest in alternatives, Canadian institutional investors are driving the demand to trade this emerging asset class on a reliable and secure platform. To meet this demand and better protect investors, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and IIROC published a new directive regarding their approach to regulating platforms that engage in the trading and custody of crypto assets and contracts involving crypto assets (Staff Notice 21-329). FCC obtained decisions from the CSA and an approval from IIROC that address the expectations set out in the Staff Notice as they relate to FCC\\'s new institutional digital asset service. \"This is a very exciting development for our clients, interested Canadian institutional investors and for Fidelity Clearing Canada,\" said Scott Mackenzie, President, FCC. \"The demand for investing in digital assets is growing considerably and institutional investors have been looking for a regulated dealer platform to access this asset class. Fidelity Clearing Canada is pleased to offer our new solution, leveraging Fidelity\\'s global expertise and deep knowledge of digital assets for leading Canadian institutional investors.\" Effective today, portfolio managers, dealers, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, investment funds and other qualified institutional investors are eligible to access FCC\\'s institutional digital asset trading and custody solution. \"We look forward to working with current and prospective clients and helping them to get exposure to bitcoin,\" added Mackenzie. \"Fidelity Clearing Canada and our clients are experiencing tremendous growth and success based on',\n",
       "  'Mortgage rates jump to highest level in six months: MBA  Bitcoin rallied to a fresh record high above $65,000 on Wednesday, as excitement over its first exchange-traded fund (ETF) — and another soon to come — reached a fever pitch. As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization spiked by over 7% on the day, investor cheered the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which launched on the the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the previous session— the first ever BTC (BTC) related fund available to U.S. investors.\\xa0 While some market participants have questioned the utility of the new product, it will offer people a new way to gain exposure to BTC via brokerage accounts. BITO\\'s debut was the second largest ever for an ETF, reflecting massive interest in the crypto sector. However, incoming buyers — especially first-time crypto owners — should be forewarned: the new Bitcoin ETF(s) won\\'t trade exactly like the market digital coin that tends to fluctuate wildly.\\xa0 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the new ETF as futures based, meaning they\\'re derivative, based on the underlying BTC price. That makes them more complex and expensive to own than holding Bitcoin outright. But Grayscale Investments and the New York Stock Exchange is moving to convert the world’s biggest Bitcoin fund into a spot-based ETF, capitalizing on the market\\'s embrace of the new fund and a regulatory environment that appears to be shifting in favor of cryptocurrency. \"The daily correlation of BITO to spot Bitcoin is going to be almost perfect,\" Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, told Yahoo Finance Live, even if BITO will probably miss the price of Bitcoin by 5 to 10% over the course of a few years, he added. \"Advisors probably won\\'t buy it,\" said Balchunas. \"Its going to get exciting but that excitement will be driven by traders, not longterm investors.\" Investors have been clamoring for a fund based on spot prices that would better serve retail investors. However, the SEC chose to approve BITO first because, as futures-based products they are governed by a 1940s law act that gives']}"

Additionally, we applied the text classification on the results of sentiment analysis pipeline to perform predictive analysis on our data. We got an accuracy of nearly 77% with Linear Support vector classifier model. Along with the accuracy, we have better precision for positive summary predictions and better recall for negative summary predictions. Overall there is better f1-score and accuracy. Our model did well in performing the text classification. \n"
